# Variational Auto Encoder
The component which we had to reinvent.
## Why?
For a typical topic modeling problem, an auto encoder is required. So we were assigned the task of creating one.
<br>
## What we learnt
The journey down this project was much more memorable and difficult than what was expected.
## What we actually did
The auto encoder we developed works on images.
## What we have left to do
The auto encoder must be made to work with text as input.
