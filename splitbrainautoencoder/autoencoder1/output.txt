Many factors can contribute to the intracellular heterogene-

stochastic fluctuations [3], [7], [8], [14], [23] in gene expression,
and genetic heterogeneity [27]– [29], etc., during the biological
processes.8, we quantified the correlation coefficients

strength can be calculated by the variance divided by the mean
expression level of the cell population [14], [21]–[23].The different values of R2 among different independent cell

DISCUSSION
The pulmonary edema that characterizes ARDS impairs sur-
factant function and causes increased derecruitment of small
airways and alveoli.This deviation at high PEEP is proportional to the
peak pressures during the fitting period and is also reflected in
the pressure and elastance errors (see Fig.To standardize the volume history of

the estimation model prior to each run through the iterative fit-
ting algorithm, we first ventilated it for 40 s using the prescribed
ventilation pattern.The accuracy of the estimation model was further assessed
by simulating derecruitability tests in injured mice over a range
of PEEP using the best fit parameters.Also, VV has shown potential as a
therapy for ARDS [36] in both animals [20], [37], [38] and hu-
mans [36], [39] due to increased surfactant secretion [19], [26]
and recruitment [21], [26], [40], [41].Pest) when the estimation model was driven by the corre-
sponding ventilation waveform.Model fitting
was achieved iteratively using a constrained parallel pattern
search algorithm [28]–[32] that functions by repeatedly simulat-
ing pressure and flow data with the estimation model using sets
of parameter values selected from within a specified bounded
domain.5, demonstrating that a sufficient period of low-Vt ven-
tilation must follow a deep breath for derecruitment to occur
and provide information for the parameter fitting.Inspira-
tion was sinusoidal, while expiration from the model was driven
by the difference between the elastic recoil pressure within each
open lung unit and the prescribed level of PEEP.to test the performance of the estimation model
because changes in the open fraction of the lung that occur
as a result of R/D play a pivotal role in the genesis of VILI.CV-RM: Constant volume ventilation with Vt = 8.0 mL/kg
and PEEP = 3 cmH2O with two successive 50 mL/kg inspira-
tions at 0.8 Hz applied at the onset of the fitting period.The pattern search algorithm is readily parallelized [28]–[31]
because once Xk is calculated the objective function evaluation
for each trial point is independent of the others.However, as PEEP increased, the accuracy of the ?Average error in the open fraction during derecruitability tests at dif-
ferent PEEPs using parameters determined via the estimation algorithm and
compared to the simulation model for injured mice.These findings
demonstrate the tradeoff between the ability of a ventilation
mode to avoid damaging the lung (i.e., not causing large vol-
ume excursions) versus providing the information necessary to
assess derecruitability.V SimCrit

Explanation for the Performance Improvement
To understand and explain why the approaches used in the
adaptive SSVEP speller design outperformed other approaches,
we analyzed the performance improvement in terms of three
aspects.2) Data Collection: EEG signals were recorded using a
BrainAmp dc amplifier (Brain Products GmbH, Germany).For each letter selection,
the SSVEP stimuli appeared on the screen and remained
for 10 s, with the first 5 s used for row coordinate detec-
tion and the subsequent 5 s used for column coordinate
detection.Color versions of one or more of the figures in this paper are available online
at http://ieeexplore.ieee.org

disabled persons [1], [2].The results indicate that
the proposed approaches consistently achieved higher average
classification accuracy than the traditional SSVEP approaches.To verify the feasibility of the proposed
approaches, the experiments consisted of offline and online ses-
sions.2) To compare the performance of the proposed optimization
approaches for setting stimulus time, the online session
was performed using both the fixed and dynamic optimiza-
tion approaches.LED monitor with a
refresh rate of 60 Hz and resolution of 1680× 1080 pixels.Note that the stimulus times were identical for
row and column detection.Rather, to provide a standardized
spelling task, the subjects were required to spell their own
names in Latin letters three times (three runs).Because offline analysis is typically used to select the opti-
mization approach for online spelling, only the accuracy be-
tween the minimum and maximum stimulus times is considered
here (see Section II-C).EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
A. Online Performance
During the online session, each participant spelled his or
her own name three times.The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.Section V

As our haptic device
is grounded to a table and the two graspable surfaces (finger
pads) are mechanically coupled, this constraint of mechanical
equilibrium is removed.This
second DOF is mechanically decoupled from the linear gripper.In condition C7, subjects were able
to successfully perform the task on their second trial.As
both finger pads are mechanically coupled, the movement of
the fingers on the linear gripper is symmetrical, even if forces
exerted by the thumb and index finger are different, or not in
synchrony.However, when using our robotic gripper, the
movement of the fingers is mechanically coupled when subjects
grasp within the resistive viscoelastic force field, i.e., the task
could have been accomplished by using only one finger to press
against the respective finger pad.This behavior was observed in more than 90%
of the trials for all subjects.The
position of the linear gripper was recorded simultaneously us-
ing the encoder signal.Hold: After reaching the target window, subjects were asked
to hold the position for 3 s (indicated by auditory cues), and
maintain the applied force.Half cylinders made from rapid prototyping material
(FullCure720) are used as finger pads, with a guiding groove
into which the index finger and thumb can be inserted and
fixed with Velcro straps.This rotational DOF was not used in this study, and was locked
with a magnetic brake during all experiments, holding the linear
gripper in a horizontal position.(a) subjects were asked to grasp, hold,
and release the linear gripper using their thumb and index finger in opposition
(precision grip).D. Pilot Study
Eight subjects (S1–S8, six males and two females, 34.6 ±
3.7 years old (mean±SE), six right- and two left handed) par-
ticipated in a pilot experiment in which they were presented
with four pseudo-randomly selected conditions among the ones
described in Table II.The thumb and index finger
of the subjects dominant hand were fixed to the finger pads
using Velcro straps.During the entire task, the robotic
gripper simulated one of the combinations of stiffness and damp-
ing presented in Table II.(a) mean±SE over the eight subjects of the grasp duration, i.e., the time to reach the target position xt , for condition C4 (top) and condition C7 (bottom).In condition C4, subjects
required about seven trials to successfully reach the target and
perform the grasping movement within the time constraint (rep-
resented by the shaded area).Shaded areas represent the time constraint of 500 ± 100 ms for the movement to be considered successful.40 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING, VOL.46 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING, VOL.

(b) More neural spikes are evoked as the longer CHRG signal is applied.C. Operation Principle
The operation of the stimulator IC starts after the RST signal.A bipolar
stimulation method is used for this experiment.12, more neural spikes are evoked as a brighter
light illuminates the stimulator IC, or as a longer CHRG signal
is applied.We utilize the
method described in [33] to extract the retinal tissues.In this paper, a miniaturized biphasic current stim-
ulator integrated circuit is developed for subretinal stimulation
and tested in vitro.The
capacitor is used to store the voltage converted from the light.The stimulator IC has a
16× 8 pixel array in an area of 2.5 mm× 1.2 mm.Results of the preexperiment on the test board to measure variations
of the stimulation current as a function of the signal amplification using the
duration of the CHRG signal.The pixel size is further reduced by simpli-
fying the stimulation-current generating circuit, which provides
a 43.9% size reduction when compared to the design reported to
be the most advanced version to date for subretinal stimulation.In addition, the
duration of the CHRG signal determines the length of time
the capacitor is charged.The stimulation (STI) signal
determines whether or not the stimulation current is generated.Compared to a stimulator pixel that uses a four-
transistor CMOS image sensor, this design reduces the pixel size
by 8.3%.The VCCS generates a stimulation
current proportional to the capacitor voltage.Three-element circuit model connected to the electrode pads in the

The results of the phantom study also
demonstrate reliable performance according to different injection
conditions of contrast agents.However, the
HS method showed lower values for weave image sequences
under the Gaussian noise condition and produced similar re-
sults under speckle noise conditions with PSNRs ranging from
10 to 20 dB.Under this condition, the HS method yielded EPE
and WI values much lower than those for the original image,
although the noise level increased with a decrease in the PSNR.During the flow estimation procedure, typical warp-
ing values and iterations were set to 5 and 35, respectively.However, this effect
was not significant, and the proposed method showed the best
performance in terms of the EPE and the WI under all noise
conditions.To the best of our knowl-
edge, no study has estimated flow patterns of contrast agents
themselves from continuous CEUS sequences.However, manual assessments
are time-consuming, and visual methods generally show poor
accuracy because of nonlinear motion patterns and the presence
of structure noise in the image [6].The

In this paper, a systematic and quantitative approach was im-

for each fungicide, these 137 combinations were clustered into
3 groups (Groups A, B, and C) using the k-means cluster al-
gorithm [31].With these results, we compared the dosages and the costs
required to achieve the IR of 90% using single fungicide with
those using optimized fungicide combinations.Since each chemical fungicide has a well-defined mechanism
to kill or inhibit pathogens, a combination of fungicides that
function with different mechanisms should be a promising ap-
proach to overcoming pathogen resistance against a particular
fungicide [4].individual fungicides indicating that the inhibition effect by the
combination is not a simple additive effect of each compound.With this approach, single-fungicide

the sensor can exert outside its immediate vicinity is ?10 mV,

Long training,
low success rates, and poor reproducibility make these systems
incapable of injecting more than tens of cells per experiment.2) Contact Detection via Three-Dimensional Motion: The
system moves the detected empty region in the XY plane un-
til it is directly under the micropipette tip [see Fig.First, the system lacked the critical capa-
bility for automatically locating a micropipette tip.Therefore, in this system, the X–Y
stage is also servoed simultaneously to move along the direc-
tion in which micropipette tip enters the field of view, while the
micropipette tip is being lowered by the micromanipulator.Background
aberration can lead to incorrect detection (e.g., motion ambigu-
ity and distortion) and make detection fail when object motion
speed is low.When this occurs, the system moves the focal plane
up by controlling the focus adjustment motor, and the X–Y sweep
is then repeated.This process involves two
main steps: micropipette detection and autofocus adjustment.The task of lo-
cating micropipette tips in the five groups was also conducted
manually by three skilled micromanipulation operators.Locating Micropipette Tip
When a micropipette tip is mounted on the micromanipulator,
the system automatically locates the micropipette tip and moves
it to the center of the field of view.Our previously reported contact detection algorithm works well
on a bare culturing surface but has a low success rate on these
coated surfaces.When a micropipette is mounted on the system, the system
detects the micropipette tip’s position and automatically moves
it to the center of the field of view (see Section III-A).The
moving object is extracted via taking the difference between
consecutive frames.In some cases, the
micropipette tip cannot be detected when it is far away from the
focal plane.In the detection step, the micropipette is swept in the XY plane
for detecting its presence in the field of view.After the focus adjustments, the in-focus micropipette tip
is moved to the center of the field of view through closed-loop
visual servoing under a low magnification objective and then
under a high magnification objective.The detailed methods for
detecting and tracking micropipette tips are described in [18].Experimental results summarized in
Table II show that the success rates for cytoplasmic (n = 1245)

AURICCHIO et al.Moreover, it is worth underlining that we have estimated the
radial change of the aorta at each given section elaborating the

in Section II-A.As for the shape and
scale factors of the errors, the following values are assumed:

to have the square errors of one order of magnitude lower than

These filters are optimized
from the time domain [e.g., CSSP in Fig.C can be
obtained by the gradient-based learning algorithm for the second
subproblem (19).However, the spectral filters are equivalently
solved by a max-margin machine.2) The second category optimizes the
bandpass filters equivalently in the frequency domain, and thus,
these filters are called spectral filters.Whether the combination of spatial and bandpass filters such
as CSSP, CSSSP, and DFBCSP hold the connection is still un-
known.Because we use a homogenous parameter

Two horizontal slices of the 3-D activation map at a depth of 59 and 66 mm.This
procedure typically lasts for several hours before a complete
map is generated, and the target region for ablation is identified.The recording electrode lead field is also a key factor that
affects the amplitude of the AE signal.The chamber was coupled to a
large water tank that contained a focused ultrasound transducer.INSTRUMENTS AND METHODS
A. Langendorff Isolated Rabbit Heart
All procedures were in accordance with the Institutional An-
imal Care and Use Committee at the University of Arizona.Chirp excitation has been shown to be superior to
short pulse excitation for detecting the AE signal [15].The largest AE
signals were observed near recording electrode R2 due to the
strong lead field at this location.2 correspond to different
time points during the cardiac cycle at a single location of the
ultrasound transducer.Radio frequency (RF)
ablation remains the primary choice for treatment for drug-
resistant arrhythmia with approximately 100,000 procedures
performed annually in the U.S. [1].A horizontal line at the maximum AE amplitude denotes
the ECGAE signal.The experimental timing was also controlled by the mul-
tifunctional DAQ card, which generated two triggers: 1) the
pacing trigger to the function generator (Agilent 33220A) for
stimulating the heart, and 2) a 2-kHz burst trigger to another
function generator (Keithley 3390), which sent out a frequency-
encoded excitation signal (chirp) for pulsing the ultrasound
transducer.The unshielded and flexible
disc array, on the other hand, exhibited the poorest sensitivity
(0.74 ?V/MPa).This was expected
because only the ECGAE signal depends on the location of the

The border detection
process finds the border of the tumor in the dermoscopy im-
age, which is essential for an accurate skin lesion classification.Several researchers have
developed methods to distinguish between melanoma and nevus,
which are both categorized as MSL.The threshold values and the scaling factors of
the linear classifiers were adjusted in the following manner:
1) keep %M and %B greater than the predefined values, i.e.,
shown in Condition columns in Table VI and 2) maximize the
minimum of the two other detection rates [min(%N, %S)].it achieved over 80% detection rates of nevus,
BCC, and SK (%N, %B, %S) while keeping 90% detection rate

general border detection algorithm [21] for MSLs and NoMSLs.In our previ-
ous study, we developed a general border detection algorithm
[21] for both MSLs and NoMSLs.This is an inevitable
tradeoff for achieving high detection rates for both melanomas
(%M) and BCCs (%B).Thus,
early detection and appropriate treatment are essential [6].Accurate identification of

confused with melanomas.obtained by going inward from the border as in our previous

DISCUSSION
Herein, we have investigated the performances of CS-based
reconstruction versus commonly employed methods (CG and
LSQR) when performing mesoscopic fluorescence tomography.The proposed method was compared with the conven-
tional method, such as CG and LSQR methods by a synthetic
model of microvessel network in different voxel sizes (200, 100,
and 80 ?m).For the reconstruction of sparse objective function, CS tech-
niques can achieve high-quality image reconstruction from far
fewer measurements than that required by Nyquist sampling.(a) Raw data were represented in 3-D. (b) and (c) Raw data were seg-
mented for two different sets of vascular channels, T1 and T2.F. Vascular Structure Mimicking in a Collagen Scaffold
and Validation
The reconstructions employing experimental data are pro-
vided in Fig.(f) Raw data and line
profile for fluorescence (blue), background (green), and subtracted (red) data,
respectively.The task of MFMT consists in
reconstructing the unknown fluorophore parameter distribution
X based on the linear equation system (3) from the measured
data Y.Two reconstruction methods, CG
[8] and l1-norm, were used to solve the optical inverse problem
using the subtracted dataset and reconstructions are provided
in Fig.C. CS-Based Reconstruction
The key concept behind CS-based reconstructions is to exploit
the prior knowledge that a large number of the unknown coeffi-
cients are close to or equal to zero (sparse and compressible).: HIGH-RESOLUTION MESOSCOPIC FLUORESCENCE MOLECULAR TOMOGRAPHY BASED ON COMPRESSIVE SENSING 251

Fig.In this case, the objective function is extremely
sparse in the imaging domain, and, hence, very amenable to CS
methods.Examples of fluorescence, background, and
subtracted data are provided in Fig.For
instance, a visual comparison between reconstructions based on
the different inversion algorithms employed and for a 2 mm
depth location is proposed in Fig.Massively parallel implementation or matrix reduction
based on CS techniques can be employed to solve this issue.Here, we employed
the cumulative coherence function (CCF) to evaluate coherence
between the transformation matrix T and Jacobian matrix A:
CCF (m) = max max?These results suggest that CS-based reconstruction techniques
are very suitable for fluorescence tomographic imaging in the
mesoscopic regime as the image domain is generally sparse.8(d), (e), (h), and (i)
254 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING, VOL.For example, we discretized
the imaging domain into 10× 25× 15 voxels when consider-
ing a 200 ?m discretization, leading to a Jacobian of size 1750
(250 source positions, seven detectors) by 3750.

listed as follows: Ci = 25pF, Ri = 1T?, Cg = 5pF, Vn =

also used for dry electrodes [5]–[8].(a) Performance comparison of avoiding signal attenuation, and
(b) coherence analysis for different types of EEG electrodes.And
a high input-impedance bias current path Rbia , connected to a
reference voltage Vref , was also applied in the input terminal
of the active circuit to protect against the parasitic voltage and
ensure the operational amplifier working in the active region.This can be explained by that the used active circuit can
tolerate offset current to avoid the reduction of CMRR to reduce
the influence of environment noise.Toyama proposed a metal-pin electrode
with spring load [11] to measure EEG.6 (a) and (b) shows the performance comparison of avoid-
ing signal attenuation for different electrodes, and their coher-
ence analysis, respectively.Next, the performance of measuring EEG under motion for
the active CSDE was tested.Moreover, the use of grounding circuit can effectively
suppress the common-mode signal to improve CMRR.11.From (6), the noise figure F is
only about 0.000086 dB in 10 Hz.The coherences between

Then, we sug-

by human controllers when performing a 1-D manual control
task on an unstable system.LUPU et al.The
dynamics of the controlled system may be unstable and re-
quire the human operator to continuously generate control com-
mands (e.g., piloting a plane through a turbulence zone).TECHNICAL PRELIMINARIES
A. Shannon’s Information Theory
This section introduces the notation and definitions for the
information-theoretic terms that are used throughout the study.Using information- and control-theoretic approaches,
we derive the minimum rates of information transmission in man-
ual control required by any deterministic controller to stabilize
the feedback system.These studies encourage the use of information rates for char-
acterizing the human performance, especially in the interaction
with machines.Moreover, the information-
transmission rate from human to machine is expected to depend
on the complexity of the machine dynamics as well as hu-
man capabilities and limitations.In this paper, using information- and control-theoretic ap-
proaches, we first derive the minimum information rate required
for the stabilization of a feedback control system.Index Terms—Entropy rate, human-in-the-loop control, infor-
mation rate, time delay, unstable system.We propose to characterize the HMI as information
flows quantified by the information-transmission rate in bits per
second (b/s).A comparison between the information-transmission rates re-
quired for feedback stabilization and the empirically estimated
rates can provide insight into both the assessment of the hu-
man performance and the prediction of its limitations.Instead, our investigation focuses
on estimating the information rate exchanged between the hu-
man operator and machine in a feedback control system.INTRODUCTION
THE main goal of automation is to reduce human work-load in various human-machine interactions (HMIs).In a set of
tracking experiments [10], [11], the observed maximum rate of
human information processing via 1-D movement was limited
by about 9 b/s for continuous tracking and 11 b/s for discrete
tracking.In
such interactive HMI tasks, the information rates delivered by
the human should depend on the complexity of machine dy-
namics.Two scenarios are analyzed: 1)
when time delay affects the control system and 2) when the
degree of instability of the task is varied.The interaction between human and machine
can then be characterized by dynamics of information exchange
measured in bits per second (b/s).However, there is no quantitative measure of
the human performance or cognitive workload in these difficult
HMI tasks.Related Studies
Shannon developed the information theory to describe the
functionality of a communication system [6].

played one after the other and the subject had to make a de-

and each interferer, a nonparametric Wilcoxon signed rank test
was conducted with the mean scores of all subjects.There is an
ongoing discussion about the choice of the perfect gain function
that improves SI and speech quality in NH listeners [1]–[4].The ACE strategy consists of a maxima selection stage in each

channels are stimulated.In
this study, both approaches for SI and quality enhancement were
compared.For the quality im-

that a preference in a pairwise comparison correlates with a
quality advantage of the preferred signal.Only these non-overlapping lists were used dur-

was the hold time required to select a target.In fact, we recently reported conference abstracts of keyboard
applications with intracortical electrode arrays in a person with
ALS as part of the BrainGate2 FDA pilot clinical trial [26], [27],
which further emphasizes the need to optimize these systems for
maximum performance and ease of use.The sustained high commu-
nication rates found here also suggest that these systems are
capable of transmitting meaningful information for hours at a
time, an important feature of clinical neural prostheses.In the case of the grid task, this parameter
24 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING, VOL.Each block consisted of a random parameter pair
(e.g., grid task: 49 targets at 450-ms hold time) that was run for
approximately 200 trials (3–6 min).(b) Bitrate heatmap of task parameters swept for radial task.Specifically, this an-
imal model most closely mimics the neural state of a human
subject utilizing a neural prosthesis because it does not place
any constraints on neural activity.There were no breaks between
trials of an experimental block, such that a new target appeared
immediately after a selection was made.In a clinical system, this may be made more explicit by
the direct use of a pause button at the edge of the workspace,
but this is an abstract idea not within easy reach of monkey be-
havior and was thus not implemented in this study.22 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING, VOL.In this study, t was measured
as the total time elapsed between the start of the first trial of a
block to the end of the block’s last trial.The bitrate is not infinite because of the
required hold time and the 200-ms postselection lockout time.Thus, the
achieved bitrate calculated in the optimization sweeps was the
bits per trial for that task condition, multiplied by the net total
number of successful trials across all blocks of all days for a
given parameter pair divided by the total time spent across all
blocks of all days for that given parameter pair.26 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING, VOL.

Recently, much effort has been made to extend the ECG in-
verse problem to image the cardiac electrical activity throughout
the 3-dimensional (3-D) myocardium [21]–[40].This heart model was embedded in a realistic geometry inho-
mogeneous heart-torso volume conductor model [22]–[23], and
body surface potentials were generated based on forward com-
putation.By solving the ECG
inverse problem, the electrical activities can be reconstructed
by coupling the body surface potential maps (BSPMs) and
subject-specific geometric models.The ECD was then reconstructed from BSPM during
S-T segment with a time window of 30 ms and averaged over
time.This results in infarcted tis-
sues, which are considered electrically unexcitable throughout
the whole cardiac cycle or with much smaller action potential
amplitude as compared with the normal action potential.To address the issue, we simulated the situations that MI regions
are having zero electrical conductivity with the aid of the finite
element method (FEM).(t) is an M × 1 column vector of body surface po-
tentials from M body surface electrodes at time t, J(t) is a
3N × 1 column vector of ECD distribution from N myocardial
grid points, and L is the M × 3N transfer matrix that relates
the ECD distribution to the body surface measurements.Given a tessellated geometrical heart-torso model
and the prior knowledge of the electrical conductivity of rele-
vant tissues and organs [43], [44], the relationship between the
ECD distribution and the measurable body surface potentials
can be described by the following linear equation:

The state x[k] is a Gaussian random variable ini-

distribution and across-channel redundancy may, however, limit
the benefit of high-dimensional signal sets, and the increased com-

We have presented a simple and efficient method for estimat-
ing the MD of a channel in a multivariate state-space system.A. Dynamical System Model
We consider a continuous-time linear time-invariant (LTI)
Gaussian dynamical system model consisting of a latent mul-
tivariate random process, x(t), with Markovian dynamics, re-
lated to multivariate observations, y(t).We estimated the MD distribution
skewness as 3.5 (unbiased estimate, bootstrap).Blue line: computer cursor
trajectory from home position outward to target and back; red line: cursor
trajectory estimated by decoding neural activity of the m best channels ranked
by MD; black rectangle: computer screen location and dimensions; scale bar
in units of visual angle.(t) is the m-dimensional measurement
noise vector, and F(t) and H(t) are the n× n system matrix
and n×m observation martix, respectively.We estimate the MD of
each of the m channels as described below.MD, however, is instru-
mental in informing us that only a small number of channels are
principally relevant for decoding, and the preferred-direction
spread of those high MD channels is of key importance.We
present a scheme for choosing the optimal subset based on model
order selection criteria.We found 2, 12, and 18 channels to yield 50%, 90%, and
95%, respectively, of the total MD obtained with all 39 channels.We estimated the steady-state SNR ma-
trix S¯, and the MD si =
[
S¯
]
i,i
for channels i = 1, .The single-channel correlation appeared to follow an
exponential relationship with MD for a few channels in the high
MD regime, but did not have a significant relationship in the
low MD regime.The goal of variable selection is to eliminate
low-information channels, resulting in improved computational
efficiency and generalization capability.When the
two best channels were used for decoding, the trajectory esti-
mate spanned both spatial dimensions.The variable selection
process involves finding the optimal tradeoff between model
complexity and performance.(24)

Cross-sectional studies, analyzing changes in glaucoma based
on biomarkers mentioned derived from OCT, typically rely on
measurements being averaged over local, anatomically mean-
ingful areas.Different strategies employed by commercial
devices to ensure the same retinal position for repeat scans were
compared in [19].(c) Registration of the four anatomical surfaces (ILM, BM, NFL and choroid) to the template by ?s (?c (Si )).The axial resolution for
the system used to image this particular subject was lc = 6?m.The authors of [17] demonstrated 3-D
rigid registration of longitudinal data using n-dimensional scale
invariant feature transform, and nonrigid registration consist-
ing of iterative closest point algorithm for lateral registration of
blood vessel segmentation followed by graph-based search for
the optimal translation of each A-scan by mean-squared error
cost images [18].The cur-
rent run time of 11.5 h per registration may be significantly
616 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING, VOL.Similar in the
study, the automatically segmented surfaces in this report were
checked and corrected by a manual rater before layer thickness
measurement and registration.However,
in the phantom data experiment in Section III-B, we observed
that a global affine transformation to a test image was not fully
restored by the nonrigid registration only, and caused some re-
gions of slight difference in the result.The optimal registration from S to T is
performed through minimization of the following functional:
J(vt) =
?Briefly, spherical demons-based registration of surfaces
involves applying the registration ?s to ?c(S) (the inexactly
matched surface found by the method of currents), where ?s is
found by minimizing the following functional:
(?, ?s) = arg min
?Another group per-
formed intensity-based nonrigid registration of macular OCT
images [22], [23] by a combination of rigid registration, which
aligns foveae, and A-scan-wise affine and nonrigid registration
with radial basis functions.This method can also, in the
future, be used as a precursor to 3-D OCT image registration to
better initialize nonrigid image registration algorithms closer to
the desired solution.Our method is also applicable as a precursor to im-
age intensity-based registration and would help initialize the
high-dimensional nonrigid algorithms to better avoid local
minimums.Existing registration methods are classifiable
into three categories: 1) image-based registration [8]–[10], re-
lying on pixel intensity information to bring images into align-
ment (these methods, however, pose a challenge for accurate
OCT image registration due to high levels of speckle noise in
OCT images), 2) landmark or surface-based registration [11],
relying on extracted features (landmarks, surfaces) from volu-
metric images, and 3) hybrid image-surface-based registration
[12].High
dimensional nonrigid registration algorithms required for cross-
sectional and longitudinal analysis are still being developed for ac-
curate registration of OCT image volumes, with the speckle noise
in images presenting a challenge for registration.Thin-
plate spline fitting [14], feature-based registration with fiducial
markers [15], and particle filtering [16] were explored in mo-
tion artifact correction.In a nutshell, maximizing the overlap of the
coordinate functions for registration is essentially akin to finding
a regularized straight line correspondence between the two sur-
faces.610 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING, VOL.(5)

Abstract—This study considers the computationally determined
thermal profile of a fully clothed, finely discretized, heterogeneous
human body model, subject to the maximum allowable refer-
ence level for a 1-GHz radio frequency electromagnetic field for
a worker, and also subject to adverse environmental conditions,
including high humidity and high ambient temperature.As with the respiratory losses in (2), the integral
defining the heat acquisition by the blood is taken over the
whole body and Qb0 defines this heat flow under thermoneutral
conditions, necessary in order to model the correct variation in
blood temperature [31].D. Calculation of SAR Using the Finite-Difference

specific absorption rate, which can be calculated at any point in
human tissue from knowledge of the internal electric field using

homogenized liver experimental setup provided more reliable
temperature measurements for the numerical model validation.4) Boundary Conditions: For solving Maxwell’s equations, a
scattering boundary condition was imposed at the outer surface
of the homogenized liver sample.(a) Temperature comparisons between the water vapor model, the thermal-conduction model and the experimental validation at positions 5, 10, and
20 mm away from the microwave antenna.Microwave systems
are capable of creating larger and more homogenous ablation
zones compared to those made with predicate RF ablation sys-
tems, even around heat-siphoning vasculature—leading to more
complete treatment and a potentially decreased risk for tumor
recurrence [3].Chiang is with the Department of Biomedical Engineering and Department

FibNAF represents the inducibility of AF based on
reentrant mechanisms, and AF with non-reentrant mechanisms
cannot be quantified by this number.FibNAF , based on LA mass and wave-
length, correlates well with AF maintenance in computational mod-
eling and clinical AF inducibility after CPVI.V. CONCLUSION
The FibNAF , based on critical mass and wavelength, corre-
lates well with AF maintenance in computational modeling and
clinical AF inducibility after CPVI.Because no quanti-
tative clinical measure of arrhythmias due to reentry waves has
been proposed, the clinical effectiveness of FibNAF is notewor-
thy.For each FibNAF value, the time from reentry
initiation to the termination of fibrillation was recorded

The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Re-
view Board and adhered to the Declaration of Helsinki.It is predicted that
the number of individuals with AF would more than double
by the year 2050 [2].[12], FibNAF is a nondimensional
number characterizing susceptibility to fibrillation in cardiac
electrophysiology.Wavelength is another
parameter that affects fibrillation maintenance.We calculated FibNAF as follows and compared it with post-
RFCA inducibility and iPCL.E. Study Limitations
In fibrillation wave dynamics, there are a number of impor-
tant parameters that can be used to characterize wave dynamics
aside from the duration of fibrillation.Fibrillation wave dynamics as a function of FibNAF (left panel) and maintenance duration of fibrillation represented by action potential curves (right
panel).Qu [29] confirmed
the dependence of fibrillation maintenance on tissue size using
in silico modeling.It is widely ac-
cepted that wavelength relative to tissue size determines wave
dynamics characteristics [29], [31].[10] reported that the nature of cardiac wave dynam-
ics transitioned from chaotic to periodic below a critical mass
in the right ventricular tissue of swine.The APD was varied by changing the conductance of IKr and
IKs , and CV was decreased by reducing the diffusion coef-
ficients.B. Electrophysiological Meaning of FibNAF
FibN can be interpreted as the ratio of the propagating inertia
of an electric wave relative to the diffusive dissipation in physi-
ological terms [23].674 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING, VOL.(2)

Development of HEATHER for Cochlear Implant
Stimulation Using a New Modeling Workflow
Phillip Tran, Andrian Sue, Paul Wong, Qing Li?, and Paul Carter
Abstract—The current conduction pathways resulting from
monopolar stimulation of the cochlear implant were studied by
developing a human electroanatomical total head reconstruction
(namely, HEATHER).The new work-
flow was used to create HEATHER for modeling monopolar
(MP) stimulation of the cochlear implant (CI).This location was chosen to mimic the
typical location for the implant body [3].Small struc-
tures, such as the platinum electrodes of the intracochlear elec-
trode array, required a fine mesh to properly capture the geome-
try.ICEM CFD was capable of exporting various file types,
734 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING, VOL.Various compo-
nents of the mesh became disjointed, often forming very small
parts with as few as one element.[8], facial nerve stimula-
tion is a common side effect of current injection by the cochlear
implant, making it important to accurately model these effects
to better understand, and consequently, reduce their occurrence.4(a) and (b) shows two different mesh densities obtained
with CPBR values of 1 (least dense) and 8 (most dense), re-
spectively.They indicate the direction of current
flow from the stimulating electrode surface to the return elec-
trode.Since existing methods
were unable to generate the required complexity for HEATHER,

This
amounts to have, within the model, 1598 named arteries, plus
544 smaller vessels called perforator arteries, which ultimately
supply blood to peripheral regions.a) Murray law: The relation between the radius of

d2 .Alteration of the pressure pulse as it travels along the aorta to-
ward the lower limbs is in good agreement with results published
in [33] (see also Fig.In this
manner, collaterals satisfy coherence by being considered downstream vessels
with respect to the main vessels they branch off -at both extreme points-.Hence,
at each extreme of these collateral vessels, upstream direction is dictated by
the proximal direction of the main vessel the collateral is attached to.Here, it is important to recall that anastomoses are usually formed by
small collateral vessels that connect larger arteries (for instance, the intercostal
arteries connecting the internal thoracic artery to the thoracic aorta.1) Range: Most of publications in the field report average
and standard deviation or min–max range for arterial di-
ameters; in any case, the final arterial diameter is always
within the ranges reported in the literature.b) Neighborhood: The radius is considered to be equal
to surrounding vessels (for instance, the anterior
superior pancreaticoduodenal artery is located as
the continuation of the gastroduodenal artery and
preceding the inferior pancreaticoduodenal artery,
so the average of the last two arteries was used for
the former one).Proper
coupling conditions at junctions are also postulated, as well as
terminal Windkessel models.The reason to develop a detailed
description of the cardiovascular network lies on multiple and
diversified motivations.The convention employed here follows
[39], which is the International Anatomical Terminology.While the mean pressure decrease is of the order of 4 mmHg,
diastolic pressure reduces 10 mmHg, and systolic pressure
increases 30 mmHg.In
such cases, the lengths may vary, and the range reported there
stands for such occurrence variability.This paper has supplementary downloadable material available at http://
ieeexplore.ieee.org (File size: 24 MB).3) Hierarchy: Criteria were first applied to define the diam-
eter of larger arteries, and just after this, the diameter of
smaller vessels was defined.Criteria for the selection and determination of geometrical
parameters are exposed, as well as the criteria for the setting
of material parameters and outflow conditions.Other instances include the patellar network
of the knee; and palmar and plantar arches, among others.See http://www.ieee.org/publications standards/publications/rights/index.html for more information.to which blood is

The pressure inside the aneurysm sac is expected
to be below 40 mmHg (105.33 kPa) in a successfully excluded
AAA after the EVAR procedure.C. Sensors Performance in a Hydraulic Test Bench
Although a manual control of the water tap was used and thus
there was some uncertainty in the pressure levels, still a variable
pressure profile could be obtained that allows us to evaluate the
sensor performance.Since the distance between the
abdominal section of the aorta where the stent-graft is placed
and the anterior abdominal wall skin is expected to be always
higher than 20 mm [23], the system’s performance will not be
drastically compromised by the effect of the distance and the
biological tissue.Taking into account that the cardiac cycle can
reach as fast as 180 bpm (3 Hz), and that the change of rate is
below 120 ms, the pressure monitoring system needs to present
682 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING, VOL.This procedure avoids the standard procedure
based on open surgery, still mandatory in some cases, but much
more invasive than the EVAR approach.In this paper, we describe the development,
including design and performance characterization, of a flexible
remote pressure measurement system based on inductive-coupling
for post-EVAR monitoring purposes.If there is an endoleak, the
aneurysm sac pressure rises to the levels of the patient arterial
blood pressure (ABP), typically between 70 mmHg (109.33 kPa)
diastolic and 200 mmHg (126.66 kPa) [3].CONCLUSION
A surveillance mechanism, based on the measurement of the
pressure in an aneurysm sac, is an attractive solution to detect
possible post-EVAR problems.These data show that for this initial sensor
version (not optimized and with large parallel capacitances that
greatly reduces sensitivity), it would still be possible to detect
endoleaks.Oliveira?, Student Member, IEEE, Alexandra T. Sepu´lveda, Nuno Almeida, Student Member, IEEE,

Abstract—One of the currently available treatments for aortic
aneurysms is endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR).In this experiment, the measurements were
performed while gradually opening and closing the water tap
for six times, to mimic the cardiac cycle.INTRODUCTION
THE measurement of aneurysms’ intrasac pressure hasbeen reported as a reliable technique to monitor
post-endovascular repair (post-EVAR) of abdominal aortic
aneurysms (AAA) using prosthetic stent-grafts.In spite of ultrasound being safe and widely used for medical
imaging, the measurement requires the use of an ultrasonic gel
and direct contact between the skin and the transducer.The three arches
between the inductor’s coils and the membrane have a 0.25 mm
thickness and are spaced by 1.125 mm.The pressure measurement sys-
tem proposed here demonstrates that, after a refinement of the
involved technological developments, a simple yet effective and
reliable surveillance of post-EVAR is feasible and can be of
added value in the treatment of aneurysms.(4)

The characteristics of the optical
mapping images are challenging, since their lack of contrast and
well-defined features impose a limitation on the techniques than
can be used for landmark selection and motion tracking.Our implementation of
the subpixel localization of landmarks is calculated as a second-
order interpolation of every landmark using a Taylor expansion,
following Oyallon et al.As stated by Horn in [25], the OF of a pixel cannot be cal-
culated independently of the neighbor of such pixel, hence con-
straints have to be added.The videos are composed of
5000 images; each frame is 60 × 60 pixels with a resolution of
12 bits/pixel at 950 frames/s.Several
experimentally recorded videos were analyzed and yielded a
maximum motion of internal features of a 5 pixel radius; this
restriction was implemented in the matching process.ACKNOWLEDGMENT
The authors would like to thank J. Yee at the University of
Calgary for the initial validation of the OF algorithm in nonfea-
tured images.These characteristics are desirable for this
specific application but due to the low resolution of the images,
the accuracy in calculation of the gradients is compromised.INTRODUCTION
CARDIAC optical mapping is an important noninvasivetechnique for the study of cardiac electrophysiology [1].The implementation chosen utilizes the classical formulation
of energy with the utilization of median filters for the creation
of a pyramidal evaluation.Techniques for the reduction of motion artifacts include the
use of ratiometry, chemical uncouplers, mechanical restraint of
the preparation during the experiments, and the use of postacqui-
sition processing techniques.An average of 92 land-
marks were calculated when only translation was applied, 74 for

on how they are attached to the cardiac tissue.It is defined by Horn and Schunck (HS)

METHOD
A. Axon Model
A computational axon cable model was developed to define
axonal activation in response to DBS stimulation.Nevertheless,
models and simulations can be valuable for providing knowl-
edge on a general level, or when relative differences are studied.The axon models were implemented in MATLAB (The
MathWorks, USA), and the solver “ode15” was used to in-
tegrate the differential equations describing each axon cable
model.V. CONCLUSION
A neuron model valid for small axon diameters has been intro-
duced and used together with finite-element models of DBS for
calculation of activation field thresholds.Axon cable models with 21 nodes were constructed for a
range of different axon diameters (2.0–7.5 ?m) correspond-
ing to a range in intermodal length of 0.182–0.994 mm [31],
[35].One contact cathodic monopolar stimulation settings was
used together with a model of Medtronic lead model 3389.The axon cable
models were oriented perpendicular to the DBS lead in all cases.Comparison With Other Models
The results from our axon model were compared with
voltage–distance data from McIntyre’s axon model [see
Fig.The total impedance of
the model during single contact monopolar settings was 1 k?.The complexity of implementing and solving
axon models may be a major hurdle for many research groups
that would like to perform model-based investigations of DBS.(a) Comparison of our axon cable model with the axon cable model
of McIntyre et al.Finite-element models and simulations of DBS are commonly
used to calculate and display the distribution of the stimulation
field.In or-
der to compare the activation field thresholds for each entity
(VT , ET , and ?2VT ), they were normalized with the activation
field strength derived during the lowest stimulation amplitude
setting, i.e., VDBS = 1.0 V.
E. Comparison With Other Models
In order to relate our results to existing DBS models, our
results were compared with voltage–distance data from a widely
used axon model developed by McIntyre et al.Axon cable mod-
els were developed and coupled to finite-element DBS models in
three-dimensional (3-D).Our axon model is valid for smaller fiber diameters (range
1.5–10 ?m, see the Appendix) than what is commonly used
during model-based studies on DBS.However,
the mechanisms of DBS are not fully known.The mesh density

wire was transabdominally inserted via the magnetic working
channel and snared via the channel of the endoscope before
being retracted back through the esophagus mimicking the be-

by augmented leveraging of the internal magnet by guidewire

While 3-D angiograms reveal changes in the diameter of the
blood vessels over a large area during optogenetic photostim-
ulation, they do not provide high-temporal resolution images
to be used for quantification of the blood flow variations.Date of publication October 31,
2014; date of current version January 16, 2015.The average vasodilation we are reporting (20%) is
comparable to the average dilation reported by Drew et al.INTRODUCTION
CORTICAL blood flow and neuronal activation are twofundamentally coupled processes that regulate functions
in the brain.Then, subpixel motion is es-
timated by finding the overall phase change between the two
corresponding A-scans in the two recordings.4 presents velocity profiles of these vessels before(left),
during(middle), and after(right) stimulation.The intensity of the red color is proportional to the percent change
in pixel intensity from before to during stimulation.Once these proteins are
expressed, the activity of the targeted cells can be manipulated
with high spatial and temporal resolution by exposing the cells
to appropriate wavelengths [8].The system possesses an axial resolution of 5 ?m in air.The normalization cancels out the effects of
inherent depth dependent sensitivity roll-off in SD-OCT imag-
ing [39] and ensures that the dynamic range of all pixel intensi-
ties in an angiogram is limited to the interval between 0 and 1.It is well understood that neuronal activity is inti-
mately coupled to hemodynamic signals in the central nervous
system [1], [2].While these devices are less
expensive and relatively easy to use during surgeries, in terms
of image quality, they do not match SD-OCT.
SD-OCT is a fast, noninvasive, and high-resolution tomogra-
phy technique [19]–[21] that is used to image semitransparent
biological tissue of few millimeters thickness (see [22]–[27]).Therefore, consecutive A-scans have
more than 90% overlap, and it can be assumed that these scans
are recorded from the same position.T. J. Richner, S. K. Brodnick, and J. Williams, are with the Laboratory for

P LATINUM (Pt) is a noble metal that is commonly used as astimulating electrode material for neural prostheses.A. X. Nayagam is with the Bionics Institute, East Melbourne, Vic.Potential excursions
were measured (versus Ag/AgCl electrode) and used to determine
Qin j .Electrolysis of water is one type of irreversible
Faradaic reaction of particular concern since it can lead to lo-
calized pH changes [20], [22], and the evolution of gases could
physically displace tissue [20].It has
been widely used clinically in cochlear implants [1], [2], retinal
prostheses [3]–[5], cortical implants [6]–[11], and for other ex-
perimental purposes [9]–[18].Dissolution of Pt is also irre-
versible and is a concern, as it can lead to the formation and
release of toxic products [25].This work was supported by the Australian Research Council through

Shaded electrodes correspond to radius Rpr = 2

To remove the effect of common changes affecting all elec-
trodes, the deviation is computed as the distance to the average
value of the all differences, Diff , and summed over all the
electrodes

ation values for the different SNRs.The figure
also shows the effect of the smoothing window length, win.(d) Laplacian.Deviation values in the MI experiment using electrodes within radius
Rpr = 1, and different lengths of the smoothing window.For each subject, we
estimate the deviation values after swapping a pair of electrodes
selected at random among nearby electrodes (radius Rsw = 1),
as well as for more distant ones (Rsw = 2).That is, take into account
correlations across electrodes to reach better detection of anoma-
lous patterns.This is due to its high tempo-
ral resolution, portability, and relative low cost [2].The distributions of the deviation values for all subjects and
conditions are shown in Fig.This yields 52 values for each window
of data (win = 2 s, overlap = 1 s).In all cases, we observe
low specificity of the high deviation values, potentially resulting
in high-false positive rates.Moreover, the similarity in their statistic
moments highlights how difficult it may be to detect the mis-
placement based on these values alone, as shown further below.However,
the estimated distance for correct electrodes increases as well.The size of the neighborhood is defined by the radius
Rpr, as illustrated in Fig.860 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING, VOL.864 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING, VOL.Unsurprisingly, longer window length delays the change in the

scribed in Section II-C .This is central to the generation of SSMs for surfaces as it di-

to generate instances of the object that are close to those in the
training set.The displacement of the
points can also depend on specific weights given to each of them
[39].However, this median description remains implicit
as the consensus of the instances is a dense unorganized cloud
of weighted points [see Fig.In particular, there is no
direct constraint to force a point on one mesh to have a cor-
responding point in another.We present a comparison of the IMCP-GMM

available in the public domain.Thus, each point is given a global
weight based on both its intrinsic reliability (weight from the
IMCP process) and from the reliability of its neighborhood (an
unreliable point should not move if its neighborhood is even
less reliable).In
terms of compactness, IMCP-GMM produced a model, which
lies in between the two other methods.These intermediate positions were used as the moving points
in the next iteration of CPD.Each of these MV estimates

Moreover, this phenomenon, where in-

osteoclast precursors, was also reported by our previous study
[19], further hinting that exposure of LGHMF leads to activation
of NO signaling pathway.A standard curve was decided by comparison with
sodium nitrite standards.Moreover,
a recent report exhibits that aggressive osteoclast activity is
found in mice under microgravity environment, which provides
in vivo evidence for the augmented osteoclastogenesis under
conditions of weightlessness [38].On the one hand, mag-
netic field repressed some osteoclast genes in an irreversible
way.Together, these published
facts, with our findings, suggest that exposure to weightlessness
condition leads to enhanced osteoclast differentiation.Indeed, emerging
evidence implies that osteoclast belongs to the direct target for
microgravity and mechanical forces [27]–[29].The quantitative analyses of gene expres-
sion were performed using a Bio-Rad CFX96 real-time PCR
detection system (Bio-Rad Laboratories, USA).It has been previously observed
that microgravity exposure leads to enhanced mRNA expres-
sion of osteoclast marker genes in osteoclast including RANK,
Cathepsin K, and MMP-9 [27], [29], [36], [46], [47].cDNA
was transcribed from 1 ?g of total RNA using the SuperScript
III RT-PCR system.During the process of osteoclast differentiation, markedly al-
terations involving actin arrangements such as appearance of
actin cloud and pedosome belt that together identifies osteo-
clast lineage are previously described [44], [45].After three times of
rinses with TBS, cells were incubated with 0.1% Triton X-100
for 5 min and followed by labeling with rhodamine-conjugated
phalloidin (1:100) in the dark for 1 h. After washing three
times, cells were treated with secondary antibodies (goat an-
timouse rhodamine–IgG, 1:100) or other fluorescence agents.Real-time PCR
conditions are as follows: 94 °C for 30 sec, 95 °C for 5 sec,
60 °C for 30 sec, and 72 °C for 1 min for 30 cycles.LGHMF does not have acute lethal effects on osteo-
clast precursors, which offers new opportunities for osteoclast
study, perhaps even more biomedical fields.On the con-

Abstract—The accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD)
is essential for patient care and will be increasingly important as
disease modifying agents become available, early in the course of
the disease.The first shared hidden layer is used to model the correlations
between different data modalities.Determining the sensitive biomark-
ers to the progression of AD might also aid the clinicians to
discover new treatments, as well as other possible biomedical
exploration.Performance Evaluation
We compared the proposed framework with the widely ap-
plied methods using the single-kernel SVM and the MKSVM
[23], [28].For each registered 3-D image, 83 brain regions were mapped
in the template space using multiatlas propagation with en-
hanced registration approach [50].Data Acquisition and Feature Extraction
The neuroimaging data used in this study were obtained
from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI)
database1 [46].The softmax
layer uses a different activation function, which might have
nonlinearity different from the one applied in previous layers.In summary, our proposed method
outperformed the state-of-the-art SVM-based methods in most
of the performance measurements in both binary and multiclass
AD classification problems when only MR data are presented.During fine-tuning, the neuroimaging feature space is distorted
and folded to minimize the classification loss on the training
data.Approximate measure-
ments, such as the volume [21] and the cerebral metabolic rate
of glucose (CMRGlc) [22], were normally computed from seg-
mented 3-D brain regions of interest (ROI) and were used for
AD classification with support vector machine (SVM) [23],

segmented ROIs.The performance of fus-
ing modalities with multikernel SVM is shown as MKSVM.All collected brain images are first
preprocessed and segmented into 83 functional ROI, and a set
of descriptors are computed from each ROI.

In addition, the sizes and shapes of the components
in the simulation are the same with the real experimental devices.In addition, the TA
responses of the samples with different CNTs concentrations
show that CNTs can efficiently increase the TA responses.The percent-by-weight
concentrations of CNTs in the samples are 0.22%, 0.5%, and
1%, respectively.(2.25 mg/mL) concentration is within the scope of the security

(b) Then the low-rank dictionary is learned from the training data.From a combination of these error curves, the optic disc
boundary points are detected.Based on retinal structure priors, we divide the pixels along the
RPE layer boundary into training data and optic disc edge can-
didates.Since the candidate data contains regions both with and without
the RPE layer, the dictionary learned from it does not have the
low-rank property.In the train-
ing region, a low-rank dictionary based on intensity features
and local binary patterns (LBP) is learned for vertical slices
along the RPE.The optic
disc margin also provides a fundamental landmark for detecting
other retinal parts.This observation motivates
our use of low-rank reconstruction for detecting RPE endpoints.A low-rank dictionary is learned from the training data
to reconstruct candidate pixels, and the reconstruction error is
used to identify the beginning of the optic disc.As a result, the reconstruction error provides
only a weak indicator of the endpoint of the RPE layer.In the figure, the blue dashed lines

Sander Land, Steven A. Niederer, Pablo Lamata, and Nicolas P. Smith?When extreme stress
or irregular deformations are modeled, commonly used numerical
methods can often fail to find a solution, which can prevent investi-

ical context with high standards for robustness.The
method involves adding a compressibility penalty to the standard
incompressible formulation of large deformation mechanics.(e-mail: nico-

2) Observer reports: The second method for validating the
task is to use other informants (e.g., clinicians or care-
givers) to rate anxiety symptoms.Autonomic control of the heart is achieved
through sympathetic and parasympathetic influences on the car-
diac muscle, regulating the length of time between consecutive
heartbeats.Secondary analysis also showed that heart rate and skin conduc-
tance measurements provided the highest correlation with stress
levels.(12)
The above algorithm estimates the short-term innovation
mean as well as the long-term distribution of the innovation
terms.This also
makes recognition of anxiety symptoms challenging in
ASD as depending on the unique ability and sensory pro-
file of each child, anxiety symptoms may be expressed
differently than those typically associated with anxiety.Fi-
nally, we only included participants who showed an increase in
average heart rate from baseline during the anxiety task.Anxiety symptomatology was character-
ized with respect to five DSM-IV anxiety disorders (separation
anxiety disorder, social phobia, generalized anxiety disorder,
obsessive-compulsive disorder, and panic disorder) using the
parent version of the Revised Child Anxiety and Depression
Scale (RCADS-P) [31].This step also produces a set of residuals
(i.e., innovations) that quantify how closely the measurement
matches the state prediction.Participant characteristics are summa-
rized in Table I.Key ASD-related barri-
ers to anxiety treatment are impairments in cognitive ability,
communication, emotional awareness, and introspection [15].The RR series was
uniformly resampled at 2 Hz using cubic interpolation.This increase was calculated as the dif-
ference between average heart rate during baseline and the task.D. Estimation of Arousal Level
As a by-product of the estimation procedure, the Kalman
filter provides an error term k , known as the innovation, that
994 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING, VOL.In addition to its profound negative impact on physical and
mental health [12], [13], anxiety interacts with the core deficits
of ASD to exacerbate symptomatology and increase functional
impairment [14].This
leads to a decrease in R–R intervals and an increase in the heart
rate.Moreover, obtaining reliable self-
reports of anxiety is a difficult task in the population of
interest as ASD is associated with impairments in emo-
tional awareness, introspection, and communication.Kushki is with the Bloorview Research Institute and the Institute of

Fig.Lou et al.All braces in the
region are designed and built by the three orthotists.Moreover, all of these
methods consider the risk of progression when the scoliosis
is untreated, which is useful when deciding whether a patient
should be braced or not.Pe-
terson’s method has been cited numerous times and its predic-
tions are one of the inputs to Lou’s model [15].used
data from 20 braced patients to develop a linear model to predict
progression [15].SOSORT’s 2011
guidelines avoided sanctioning any method, however [32].Our model would be somewhat easier to implement than
both Lou’s and Ajemba’s models because it uses features which
are already measured at most clinics, rather than novel compli-
ance measurements.Forty one pa-
tients (46%) experienced >5° progression of their deformity
by the end of brace treatment.[15]—could not
be implemented because they use unusual inputs not routinely
measured by scoliosis clinics.The panel included
eight experts:
1) Two orthopaedic surgeons, each with approximately
30 years of experience treating Adolescent Scoliosis.The data included new measurements relating
to patient compliance.Future work will focus on collecting brace
wear information for inclusion in the model—a task which
seems feasible given our modeling technique’s apparent ap-
titude for this domain.The 90 patients included 75 girls and 15 boys, aged 13.4 ±
1.7 years.The expert’s MCC scores had mean 0.55 and stan-
dard deviation 0.08—if experts’ scores were drawn from a

Parametric study results—Hydrostatic pressure distribution in kilo-

quality criterion of this methodology.Precomputation (green) and postcomputation (blue) of the closure of the
contour by FE modeling (b).2) Does muscular activation have an impact on the elastic
properties of superficial soft tissues?Data Acquisition and Processing
A 22-year-old healthy female volunteer underwent a MRI
scan (see Fig.Several
stitching of B-mode scans from all around the leg were presented
1016 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING, VOL.In the skin and adipose tissue, inhomogeneous ma-
terial properties around the locations of the mechanoreceptors
may also cause significant differences in the spatial distribution
of candidate relevant stimuli of the pressure.RESULTS
A. B-Mode Assembly
A stitched reconstruction of the 37 B-mode scans without
constraining the contour to be closed is shown in Fig.Hydrostatic pressure was chosen for the analysis
because it does not depend on the coordinate system and can be
used to predict local fluid flows.It consists of continuum plane strain elements, except for skin and
MCS, composed of truss elements.Regarding
the model at 10% MVC, a parametric study was performed on
the elastic moduli input deeper than the fascia cruris to evaluate
1014 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING, VOL.Here, the error was considered to be systematic between
all the images.To analyze the impact of
the input value below the fascia cruris in our contracted model,
a parametric study increasing this value up to 20 times the value
inputted for the model at inactive muscle state was performed.), permitting a stitched reconstruction of
the whole distribution of the elastic moduli.This geometry was used to create a 2-D FE mesh, made of four-
node plane strain elements, using the meshing tools available in
Abaqus (see Fig.V. CONCLUSION
In this paper, a new methodology coupling MRI and TUSE
data were developed and implemented in a FE model, which is
patient-specific in terms of geometry and material properties.Then, each image was aligned within

The decoding window w ranged
from 2 to 18 s after the metronome began to tick; thus, we omit-
ted the first and last 2 s of every MI phase to avoid any transient
response of the zero-phase filter.Potentially, instead of the cursor, a robotic arm or
neuroprosthesis could also have been controlled.Subjects s3 and s6 showed no significant differ-
ence between correlations yielded by the H- and V-models and,
therefore, did not reach a significant classification accuracy.Here, we used preprocessed data
between 2 and 18 s after the start of the metronome.An explanation could be the fact that s3 and s6 indeed partly
reached significant correlations, but with no exploitable differ-
ence between the classes allowing a classification.Of course, in addition to
a decoder, this also necessitates a highly sophisticated neuro-
prosthesis and compensation for the lacking sensory (especially

The mean and standard
deviation (SD) of the displacement, strain, and Young’s mod-
ulus of the PTT were calculated over this ROI across multiple

UEI (red).The speckle tracking coefficient and B-mode movie pro-
vide feedback for the quality of the images.The development of
techniques for precise and accurate measurement of the inver-
sion force would be an important step in the development of
UEI as a clinical tool for guiding treatment of tendinopathies.In conclusion, we have demonstrated that ultrasound elas-
tography reliably quantifies the mechanical properties of the
PTT in a human cadaveric model.Strain was calculated from the
displacement along the tendon axis (longitudinal, or x direc-
tion): For each pixel, the longitudinal stain Sxx was calculated
from Sxx = (d2 ?Our results indicate that UEI is ca-
pable of accurately measuring the mechanical properties of the
human PTT in a cadaveric model.However,
Young’s modulus was not significantly different between the
two groups, implying that Young’s modulus for thawed PTTs is
likely similar to fresh PTTs.Young’s
modulus Exx was then computed by dividing the estimated
stress by the measured strain (Exx = ?/Sxx ).probe was held by an experienced sonographer with its long
axis aligned parallel to the PTT.This would require estimating tensile load (or
stress) noninvasively, which is a challenge in vivo.This has led to prolonged unsuccessful
conservative treatment in some patients and premature surgi-
cal intervention in others.Another potential limitation of the study relates to speckle
tracking noise and out-of-plane motion of the tendon.R. S. Witte is with Biomedical Engineering, Optical Sciences, University of

We separated the 36 bowel segments with
CD areas into two parts.An
example is an iterative registration procedure that was proposed
by Buonaccorsi et al.Based on the head-to-foot translation curve
derived from this rigid registration, we select all local minima
which represent the expiration phase (see Fig.The
synthetic maps were used as fixed reference volumes to drive
the registration of the raw time point images.Data
The MRI data employed in this paper were taken from a prior
study of consecutively included patients with luminal CD [27]
that has been approved by the local Medical Ethics Committee.The black circles in the inset correspond to
the gated volumes that are in the expiration phase.After selection of the expiration-phase images, we align these
data by a B-spline transformation that maximizes the NMI.: EXPIRATION-PHASE TEMPLATE-BASED MOTION CORRECTION OF FREE-BREATHING ABDOMINAL DCE-MRI 1217
The aforementioned studies paid specific attention to breast,
cardiac, liver, and renal DCE MR imaging.[20], aiming to register motion deformed
liver images to synthetic images.[3] used multivariate analyses correlating radi-
ological features to the Crohn’s Disease Endoscopic Index of
Severity (CDEIS) [4], which is often considered the reference
standard.Un-
fortunately, respiratory and peristaltic motions complicate an
easy analysis of such curves since spatial correspondence over
time is lost.Step 1 (Selection of ten reference volumes): Divide the 450
volumes into ten consecutive subsets with an equal number of
images, i.e., 45.The choice for expiration-phase gating will be compared to
using other phases of the respiratory cycle such as the inspiration
phase and the arbitrary phase.In this paper, we avoid the randomness of the algorithm’s
performance as well as a potential bias by building an expiration-
phase reference instead.A
tri-exponential function fit to time intensity curves from regions of
interest was used to indirectly assess the performance.Therefore, abdominal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is
now widely studied for diagnosing and grading luminal CD.Head-to-foot displacement of each volume with respect to the
expiration-phase template as a function of time shows oscillatory behavior due
to respiration.A navigator echo samples a small column of tissue in

The continual cycle
of interaction with the system to perform a task is extremely
flexible and adaptive, and aspects of action and perception are
present in each of the underlying mental processes associated
with interactive systems [28].2) Objective: In this paper, we propose an AR system to as-
sist novice surgeons in developing the cognitive skills demon-
strated by experts in planning tumour resection interventions.In their proposed reality-virtuality continuum,
the mixed-reality spans from environments, in which the virtual
information augments the real view (AR) to those where real
information augments the virtual scene [augmented-virtuality
or (AV)].1(a)], or through interaction with

entry from the display frame of reference to the object frame of
reference, i.e., the patient’s skull in the operation room.By doing so, it is then possible to
visualize and manipulate patient volumetric images simultane-
ously, where the visual and haptic environments are registered.The microscope-assisted guided interventions system
[22] is another example, where 3-D preoperative images were
overlaid into both eyepieces of the binocular optics of a surgi-
cal microscope.[23] made use of AR to improve
the endoscopic view by registering real endoscopic and virtual
preoperative images together.This is of particular importance in neurosurgical planning, in
which the entire process can vary significantly, depending on the
modes of visualization and interaction.[27] augmented intraoperative views of the operative

Using an interactive system often involves executing a col-
lection of mental processes.These transformations correspond to mentally
rotating, translating, or scaling an entity to transform its spatial
location and orientation from one frame of reference to another.In this system, a camera and an LED infrared flash is
incorporated into the HMD, preventing the lag between render-

the parameters ?A limitation of the sequential HAC method is that it is de-

take anatomical information into consideration as a prior.It was originally designed
to work with baseline algorithms, such as k-centers (designed to
find k clusters by minimizing the within-cluster distances) and
k-affinity propagation (k-AP, finding k clusters based on the
exchanged real valued messages between data points), which

Methods: We have utilized
the advanced morphology and segmentation methods for process-
ing of a series of the images.It should be
noted, however, that the compared results come from a study
[18], in which a different imaging technique (MR) was used for
evaluations of different (carotid) arteries.The obtained data indicate that, practically in all cases, the
outcomes of the APXwM and GMMwM methods concurred
1498 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING, VOL.The erroneous estimation of this threshold may
change the calculated ratio of the plaque-to-the lumen area.Overestimation of
the threshold value by 2% led to a decrease in this ratio from
11% to 9.2% (a 1.8% change).11(b)], the total area of the
lumen and the plaque [see Fig.Indeed, it can effectively support the quantitative evaluation of
changes in the atherosclerotic arteries.Recent progress in mathematical morphology (an excellent
overview of the morphological image processing and analysis is
given in Soille [3]) offers very efficient tools, which can be used
to develop the more advanced medical image analysis methods.In the present investigation, a computer software for semi-
automatic artery tracking and for quantitative measurements of
atherosclerotic changes in the common iliac and femoral arteries
visualized in a sequence of CT images is proposed.This could result from 1) a very
small area of a calcified plaque (a poor representation of this
type of lesions in automatic recognition process), or 2) inhomo-
geneous contrasting of the lumen.This point is identified by approximating the sorted pixel in-
tensity curve with a polynomial function and, then, calculating
its derivative.Based on the obtained numerical results, we conclude that: 1)

For depth judgments, the disc was suspended on the

was correctly reported 68% of the time, significantly above
chance performance (p  0.001, n = 93, two-tailed binomial
test, Bonferroni–Holm corrected).In all cases,
the helmet with microphones and speakers was mounted on a
Styrofoam dummy head.Additionally, pulse-
echo exemplars from each stimulus position were recorded with

sampled every 100 ?s, the overall playback of the echoes is not
time stretched, no pinnae are used, the binaural microphones are
placed only 2 cm apart, and microphone and transducer fidelity
is unknown.To this end, open-ear headphones ensure that the ear re-
mains unobstructed, as described in Section II.Because there
appeared to be little benefit from feedback for these judgments,
we conclude that it may be unnecessary for laterality judg-
ments.The horizontal

device, largely to navigate the corridors near the laboratory.However, our tasks were expressly designed
to assess rapid, intuitive use of the echo cues provided, while
the spectral cues from new pinnae take time to learn; elevation

and recovering performance after modifying the pinna can take
weeks [23].(c) Photograph of one of the artificial pinnae used, modeled

call—the narrowband call, named for its narrower frequency
range—is used for detection and classification of objects, typi-
cally at longer range.Performance was still at chance for elevation, indicating
that feedback over the course of a single experimental session
was insufficient for this task.3) Step 3: The computer records audio through the helmet

On the other hand, it indicates the possibility that high-level
complexity in personalized anatomical models might not be
necessary for reliable EP imaging and, as a result, the process
of anatomical modeling in current EP imaging systems may be
simplified for improved clinical feasibility in future practice.(17)
In this way, the mean and variance of EP imaging output (16)
and (17) are calculated, which provide information about the
distribution/uncertainty of the EP imaging solutions.Furthermore, it will shed lights on
the quality of anatomical models that is actually needed for reli-

for establishing a clinically practicable procedure of anatomi-

carried out on each sample to obtain the corresponding outcome.The infarct re-

variations in input anatomical models.To move toward future clinical trans-

remain to be examined regarding both their clinical practicabil-
ity and their influence on the robustness of these systems.In these experiments, we employ
two of the existing EP imaging methods as testbeds: epicardial-

When S is
linearly interpolated to smaller resolutions (0.01 and 0.1 mm),
a decrease in reconstruction quality due to numerical instabil-
ity of the matrix can be observed, as only linearly dependent
information is added to the matrix.Another technique is magnetorelaxometry,
which allows the imaging of larger volumes but has a smaller
resolution than MPI [16]–[18].62, NO.62, NO.62, NO.62, NO.62, NO.The resolutions of these parameters determine
the M to N ratio of F and the resolution of R. Our aim is to have

Estimated FVC de-
rived from the incomplete curves were close to FVC from accepted
maneuvers.Estimated FVCest is closest to measured FVCmea in
restrictive disease group, which can just right meet the request
of high accuracy of FVCest because of low expired volume.proposed a regression equation for estimating
FVC from measured values of the forced expiratory volume in
2 s (FEV2) and the forced expiratory volume in 3 s (FEV3).Abstract—Objective: The aim of this study was to estimate forced
vital capacity (FVC) by analyzing incomplete forced expiratory
flow–time (FEFT) curves using the new Luus–Jaakola (NLJ) op-
timization procedure.When the length of the observed curve reaches 3 s, estimated
FVC3 was very close to FVCmea .5 shows an example of analysis of complete and incom-
plete FEFT curves using the NLJ optimization procedure.Moreover, by comparing the estimated FVC de-
rived from the 0–3 s of the incomplete FEFT curve and the whole
incomplete curve, we found that the method described earlier
Fig.For improving the reliability of this method, FEFT
curves were rejected if at least one of the following conditions
was observed: 1) any discernible cough or varying effort during
the forced expiratory maneuver; 2) the length of the FEFT curve
was less than 6 s except that the forced expiratory time of the
patients with restrictive ventilatory defect can be more than
5 s; 3) a poor start of test, or back-extrapolated volume >5%
of total expiratory volume or 0.15 L, whichever was greater;
(4) end-of-test volume >25 mL.All data are presented as mean ±
SD or number.The value of ?,
varying according to the following formula ((11)), can speed
up the convergence of the NLJ optimization procedure with a
good result [20], [31]; 2) f(t) denotes the observed curve; 3) in
Fig.The estimated FVCest is close to the measured FVC as the
length of the observed curve increases.Proceed-
ing further, the forced expiratory time may affect the accuracy of
estimated FVCest .FVCest estimated by the NLJ
optimization procedure is close to measured FVCmea when the
length of the observed curve needing to be identified is appro-
priate.To further evaluate the performance of the method for esti-
mating FVC, complete and incomplete FEFT curves from nine
patients with obstructive ventilatory defect, were analyzed by
the method described earlier.proposed a regression equation for estimating FVC from mea-
sured values of FEV2 and FEV3 , and used FEV1 /estimated
FVC to detect airflow obstruction.The first part of the accepted
FEFT curve is taken as the local system observation.The first part of the accepted FEFT curve is taken as the local

D. Statistical Analyses
In order to validate this method, one accepted FEFT curve
with the measured FVC (FVCmea) was selected from each sub-
ject in data I.Second, the dif-
ference between estimated FVCest and measured FVCmea is
large for the rough FEFT curve because of significant cough-

arbitrary shapes and structures as can be seen in X-Ray structure
analysis of this type of molecules [13].The antibodies will perform random motions
and collide with the membranes of the cells, thus affecting the
distribution of their concentration.3,
the blood velocity field drives the transport of antibodies in the
vascular region, and also the antibodies diffuse randomly by
Brownian motion.The geometry of the antibody has an important effect on its
motion in the blood and tissues.This model is deterministic, but it should be noted that there
are many fluctuations in drug delivery systems in general ow-
ing to blood turbulence, Brownian motion, and ligand-binding
noise.The networks consists of 9 curved blood vessels.This can be explained by the fact that a spherical shape maxi-
mizes the contact surface area of the antibodies, which causes
more collisions, and therefore a higher diffusion coefficient due
to Brownian motion.Color versions of one or more of the figures in this paper are available online
at http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.7, JULY 2015
The interplay of these different transport and kinetic processes
contributes to the performance of the ADDS in maximizing the
delivery of the antibodies to the diseased cells.The geometry consists of
two domains, namely the blood vessels and the ECM that sur-
rounds it.Based on
the general theory of diffusion developed by Brenner [4], the
irregular shape of molecules has an important effect on their
transport.This material is based on work supported by the FiDiPro

the first stage of GMM1SH are given in Table V. Both SE and
SP are rather high (90%), which is promising for prospective
clinical applicability if the aim is to detect a deviation from the
normal (healthy) condition.Through employment of the VAR model, the temporal rela-

In this paper, we first show the performance of the proposed
method for EEG data recorded outside of a scanner on which an
artificial GA is superimposed, so that we have a ground truth for
evaluating the performance.To take advantage of
both algorithms, we initialize IVA-L with a solution from IVA-G
to achieve IVA-GL decomposition, as in [25], since it has been
shown that this yields a more robust estimator than using either
IVA-L, or IVA-G .The extension of BSS to

ple observations [23], [24].N , while minimizing the entropies of the

The double-row MTL array presented here
is easy to fabricate in practice, and very suitable for designing
large-sized parallel arrays with large channel counts at ultrahigh
fields.To further present the improved parallel performance of the
double-row design, the average, and maximum g-factors in the
sagittal plane using the 16-channel array were measured, cal-
culated, and compared with those from a regular eight-channel
array.6(a) shows the transmit field (B+1 ) maps in the trans-
verse (upper panel) and sagittal (lower panel) planes obtained
from each row of the double-row array.The sequence parameters
were set as follows: FA = 25°, TR = 100 ms, TE = 10 ms, FOV
= 210× 210 mm2, matrix = 256× 256, slice thickness = 5 mm,
number of excitation (NEX) = 1, bandwidth = 320 Hz/pixel.The coil sensitivity profiles of individual element of the
proposed double-row MTL array were acquired and presented
in Fig.This problem could be addressed by using multiple-row MTL
transceive arrays, which are able to provide enough longitudi-
nal coverage by using regular or even shorter MTL elements.The parameters of the GRE
sequence used were flip angle (FA) = 25°, TR = 100 ms, TE
= 10 ms, field of view (FOV) = 210 × 210 mm2, matrix =
256× 256, slice thickness = 3 mm, bandwidth = 320 Hz/pixel.With the proposed multiple-row design, a
large imaging coverage was obtained meanwhile the length of
each element was significantly shortened.Considering that there
are two elements arranged in the z-direction, the double-row
design should also be capable of performing acceleration lon-
gitudinally, which is almost impossible for a single-row design.5 shows the S-parameter matrix and noise covariance ma-
trix of the 16-channel double-row MTL transceive array loaded

double-row design, compared with the regular single-row array,
improved the g-factors and, thus, parallel imaging performance
in the AP direction, even that both arrays have the same num-
ber of coil elements in this direction.With independent transmit elements from different rows, the
multiple-row MTL transceive array could offer the possibility
of RF shimming and pTx along the z-direction.C. Transmit Field Profiles, Human Head Images, and Parallel

The aggregation size
obtained after the initial time delay from donors n2 , n3 , and n4
was in the range of 400 < y(t) < 800 ?m2 .The initial gain between the size of the platelet aggregate
and shear rate, represented by the model parameter c0 , was also
significantly different for one of the donors.The lowest value of shear rate set at the input, u(t) = 120 s?1 ,
led to complete platelet aggregate disintegration, y(t) ?Before the latter pulse occurred,
t = 50min, the stenosis wall included a highly active monolayer
of platelets, not registered in the aggregate size measurement due
to its small size, expressing an effect that greatly enhanced the
amount of aggregation.Interestingly, although the initial aggregation response
from the different donors varied widely, the final aggregate size
of all donors appeared to converge near to y(t) = 2000 ?m2 .Section IV-A, presents the design of an experiment
that aims to reveal the dynamics of platelet aggregation un-
der different conditions of disturbed flow.For this, we treat the
platelet aggregation in response to a range of shear rates within
a microfluidic device [21] as an abstract unknown nonlinear
system, and draw on concepts common in Dynamic and Control
Systems, namely System Identification [26].Different conditions of
shear rate were obtained by dynamically altering the value of
the flow rate in the device.These results show the
evolution of the aggregate size, y(t), as the shear rate expe-
rienced by the platelets was altered dynamically, u(t) (See

from n1 presented double the size of the aggregate from n2
despite having an approximately 30% count value.The size of the aggregate is represented by the area
measured inside the detected aggregate from the epi-fluorescent images, and
the blood flow conditions are represented by the shear rate in the microchannel
upstream of the contraction.Let us denote the
input and output of the system at time t by u(t) - shear rate, and

1) A histopathology image is a final output of a biopsy
processing pipeline including sectioning, staining, and
imaging.Compared to existing adaptive stain decom-
positions whose performance are prone to be affected by
achromatic pixels, a key characteristic of our algorithm
is its noise-resistant property contributed by the proposed
saturation-weighted (SW) statistical method.In histopathology images prepared in different pathology lab-
oratories using different equipment, color variation is usually
observed due to operational inconsistency in image preparation

on study [11] was proposed in [12].Variation in biopsy imag-

operational inconsistency in histopathology image preparation,
images of biopsy samples stained by the same types of chemical
dyes usually appear in different colors.Based on an
imaging model where image colors were linear combinations
of stain spectra in the OD domain, a plane fitting method was
achieved by singular value decomposition and thresholding for
images containing two stains only [7].In evaluation, we use two pub-
lic datasets that are representative of histopathology images com-

2) Switched Mode Coil-efficiency Comparison of the Three
Modes: As discussed above, one potential advantage of allow-
ing unilateral operation on the switched-mode coil is higher
power efficiency over the bilateral mode.The switched-mode perfor-
mance was also evaluated.Each quadrature unilateral coil consisted of a Helmholtz pair
and a saddle pair, as previously described in [21].The DS for a 90° tip angle using the switched-
mode coil was recorded during the transmit gain calibration

output power of each case, scaled to 0 dB for the bilateral

mode coil operates in a bilateral mode, the coupling between the
two closely spaced quadrature coils creates multiple modes with
different relative current amplitudes and phases in the elements.Schematic of switching network for operating mode control of the
Helmholtz/saddle pairs.Since clinical
breast imaging requires a bilateral coil, the FCE principle was
extended to the operation of two unilateral coils simultaneously,
or individually.F. Coil Testing—MRI Experiments
The switched-mode coil performance was evaluated on a
whole-body 7 T scanner (Achieva, Philips Medical Systems).The new coil can be con-
figured for either bilateral operation or unilateral operation for
either breast.Accordingly, the SNR is also
higher in unilateral mode, by reciprocity.The switched-mode coil was evaluated on
the bench and through MRI experiments in its different config-
urations.A switched-mode coil operated at 7 T intro-
duces significant challenges due to the high coupling between
two closely spaced unilateral quadrature coils when operated si-
multaneously.at their feed-
points and excited in quadrature mode.Symmetric performance is observed in the bilateral mode,
while excellent signal localization is seen in the unilateral modes.The results in Table II demonstrate that the switched-mode

The

to identify ttrunc .Index Terms—Echocardiography, indicator-dilution curves,
pulmonary transit time, signal processing.Therefore, the body of the LDRW model,
which can be treated as a probability density function, becomes
wider as contrast progresses from the site of injection.E. Cumulative Sum Algorithm
In order to provide a secondary computational method of
comparison that is more readily applicable to noisy signals than
MTT, a cumulative sum (CUSUM) algorithm, commonly used
as a statistical method of step detection in time series data,
was implemented.For example, the be-
ginning of the signal window can be triggered simultaneously
with the start of contrast injection, and the truncation algorithm
can automatically identify the signal truncation point.Additionally, two patients were enrolled in the study
Fig.We chose MTT determined
from first-pass model fitting for comparison with our inflec-
tion point method, as MTT-determination is currently the most
prevalent computational method for the determination of PTT
from contrast echocardiograms [4], [11].For
each signal measurement Ii , a CUSUM statistic Si is generated
[see Fig.The truncation point ttrunc was subsequently identified using
a modification of the method in [18] to systemically identify the
onset of indicator (contrast) recirculation.The RV ROI was placed approximately 1 cm distal to the
tricuspid valve leaflet tips equidistant from the interventricular
septum and RV free wall.S. M. Boronyak and W. D. Merryman are with the Department of Biomedical
Engineering, Vanderbilt University.Contrast echocardiography is a more
readily available and less expensive noninvasive technique for
the determination of PTT.Blood volume estimation from contrast echocardiography has
been found to be strongly correlated with the standard of ther-
modilution [7], with the added benefit that contrast echocardio-
graphy is far less invasive.|

By spatially confining the US beam, images based
on the optical properties of tissue localized within the US field
can be obtained via detection of the modulated light.The bioluminescence fluence
rates are calculated for each of these phases, which represent
one time point in the period.A more sophisticated model would
make all the speed related parameters in Section II functions of
position and time instead of constants.The pressure distributions set up by each
frequency will vary as a result of their differing wavelengths and
their size relative to that of the bioluminescence source.Depending on the distribution of the sinusoidal pressure
along the US transmission direction, the USMBL signals can
sum either constructively or destructively at the detector, which
results in an oscillation of the modulation depth over time.Here,
the 1-mm diameter source simulated corresponds to distances
equal to ?/2, ?, and 3?/2, respectively of the three frequen-
cies studied.Here, the SNR was found to be 80, and the image lateral
resolution was 3 mm at a depth of 7 mm within a tissue phantom
with a scattering coefficient of 30 cm?1 .These variations are a re-
sult of the sinusoidal nature of the modeled US wave, which
produces a spatial and temporal variation in pressure along the
focal zone, both of which are a function of the applied US
frequency.In
USMOT, light illuminates the tissue, and US is used to modulate
its optical properties (absorption coefficient, reduced scattering
coefficient, and refractive index) at a rate corresponding to the
US frequency, which subsequently produces frequency modu-
lated light.wt) (2)
where A = P0/(wus?0va) is the particle displacement ampli-
tude [15], which is a function of the US pressure, the US angular
frequency (wus), the mass density of the sample (?0), and the
acoustic velocity in the sample (va ).Conventionally, temporally coherent light has been used
in USMOT.The relative phase of the US is labeled on the x-axis.Here, image
formation is based on the acoustic signals radiating from the sur-
face of the sample, which are scattered much less in tissue than
light.The vertices of the Delaunay trian-
gulation were used as point sources and point detectors forming
the source and detector, respectively.This linear relationship between modulation

These 37 multiscale energy features with lower p-value are sta-
tistically significant for MI detection.Various pathological MI cases such as AMI, ALMI,
ASMI, IMI, ILMI, and IPLMI are used for detection and lo-
calization.Based on ST
elevation, MIs are categorized as ST-elevated MI (STEMI) and
non-STEMI [5].A large
value of C corresponds to the model with low bias and higher
variance, which can cause data overfitting.The compu-
tational times for each stage of MI detection and localization
are shown in Table VIII.Since various
categories of MI evolved in different leads, it is expected that
monitoring all 12 leads over time will yield a better result in
the detection and localization [6].For pathological cases,
the mean and variance values of first six principal components
(PCs) at A6 , D6 , D5 , and D4 , differ from the HC cases.These differences between the
leads show that MI pathologies can be localized.For lead-I of
cD6 scale, the mean and variance values are 0.235 and 0.043,
respectively, for MI, while for HC, mean and variance values are

Therefore, instead of attempting to remove the
structured noise in the spatial domain, the aim here is denoising
the signal in the temporal domain—a much easier task.The quality of the estimation was
quantified by the MSE and correlation coefficient (R) between
these estimations and the averaged regional measurements.The performance of wavelet denoising was com-
pared against MIP, temporal compounding, and Log-normal model
fitting.For each vial, a range of contrast agent dilutions spanning
four orders of magnitude were scanned (see Table I).represents the additive noise component.They pre-

K-distribution was proposed as a model that can describe the sig-

performance of TC and WD are compared against the MIP
and the log-normal model fitting.This additive noise
component can be removed using a variety of classical denoising
methods, for example, wavelet denoising [6], [7].The denoising procedure was later
validated and shown to be effective (see below) over a wide range
of UCA concentrations including low UCA concentrations

A. Domain Transfer Learning
Domain transfer learning is a recently developed machine
learning technique, which is able to learn a set of related mod-
els from the target domain and its related auxiliary domain for
improving the classification performance in target domain [26]–
[28], [38], [46].Then the cross-
domain kernel matrix K can be computed as
K =

?First, our pro-
posed method is based on the single auxiliary domain data (i.e.,
AD and NC) from the ADNI database.Specifically, in our
proposed DTSS model, we first employ the kernel learning tech-
nique to map sample set from the original space to the kernel
space, where multitask Lasso is then performed for sample se-
lection.Then, we adopt the adaptive SVMs method in [26] to learn
the ultimate classifier f (s).Selected stable brain regions by three different methods on (top) MRI and (bottom) PET images.C. Image Analysis

2, it is apparent that both
approaches exhibit similar performance for the two examined
features, i.e., SWBC and WBSAmp.T |Wx (?, ?6(a) and (b), where the estimated IWBSAmp [(a),(b), up-

the R/M/P states.3, MAH overpasses the performance of k-
NN classifier, independently from the T value.Sim-
ilar to [21] and [35], the employment of the delta band, however,
connects with primitive defensive behaviors associated with pe-
riaqueductal gray (PAG) activity, which results in an increase of
delta oscillations [36].In particular, by combining the CWT with HOS, a new
feature space was formed, exhibiting an efficient classification
performance under various PCSs.In general, the derived CA values, based on MAH
classifier, vary between ?80% and ?90% independently from
the T value indicating a quite robust classification performance
of the adopted feature set.In particular, for the
case of a reference state (RS) employment, each of the above
described features was reshaped to a new F form, computed as
F =
P ?R

where P represents the quantity (feature) estimated during the
pain state period and R represents the quantity (feature) esti-
mated during the relax state used as a RS (see Section IV for
the selection of the time duration of P and R states).Moreover, a decrease in the
average WBSAmp is observed in left parietal (P7) in the beta
frequency band during the P state.Estimated CA ± std per Nw when using {delta, beta} EEG fre-
quency bands, the MAH: Mahalanobis [29] (solid line), and k-NN: k-Nearest

bands, i.e., delta (1–4 Hz), theta (4–8 Hz), alpha (8–13 Hz), beta
(13–30 Hz), and gamma (30–49 Hz); thus, the average values of
the aforementioned features were separately estimated for each
of these frequency bands transferred to the principal area of the
bifrequency domain (?).Topographical plot of the average WBSAmp across trials with respect
to each electrode site for: the R (first panel) and P (second panel) states, the

WBSAmp during the P state as compared to R state is observed

We first threshold the original volume with the threshold param-

is assigned a label i and ordered by its size.In
contrast, the number of wrongly separated seeds (FD3) is bigger
when a high threshold t (e.g., t = 1900) is used; this is because
of the loss of shape information of the seeds.As concerns the Dose Volume Histograms
no significant difference could be demonstrated between dose
evaluation using or not orientation information but our number
of patients was quite small.Separation result of a union-seed with four closely spaced seeds using
two methods: k-mean-FS (yellow cylinders) and GMM with the EM algorithm
(cyan cylinders).These modalities have different advantages and drawbacks: US
is a nonradiating modality as compared to X-ray but seeds are
more difficult to detect in US due to resolution, noise and reflec-

method [6] for orientation estimation is applied.Holes were drilled into the slabs to place the
radioactive seeds in different orientations.From this experimental result, we suggest choosing the in-

the radioactive seeds can be most successfully separated from
the other material.The results herein were quickly obtained with only small

Fol-
lowing validation, the SNESIM algorithm was also adapted to
enable the generation of ICC networks across a spectrum of
depletion levels.The computational cost of using the modified SNESIM al-
gorithm to generate virtual networks is approximately double
that of using the SNESIM algorithm as there are two train-
ing networks, and for each pixel simulated PDFs need to
be retrieved from two search trees.Experimental imaging of these large-scale networks remains chal-

the generation of realistic virtual ICC networks in silico using
the single normal equation simulation (SNESIM) algorithm.The generation of virtual ICC networks
proposed here can establish a more sophisticated model of GI
tissue and, therefore, offers potential for the previous studies
to be repeated and extended in a more physiologically realistic
manner.The PDF adjustment to account for the local marginal PDF

ICC depletion is thought to play a key role in GI dysmotility;
however, a major constraint restricting the investigation of ICC
network structure–function relationships is the paucity of imag-
ing data.This study now aims to advance, validate, and demon-
strate proof-of-principle of the SNESIM algorithm for gener-
ating realistic virtual ICC networks.However, the mechanisms relating
ICC structure to GI function and dysfunction remains unclear,
partly because there is a lack of large-scale ICC network imag-
ing data across a spectrum of depletion levels to guide models.Normally, serotonin acts on 5-HT2B recep-

in the petroleum industry for building realistic statistical mod-

To approximate catheter cooling, a fixed temperature boundary
condition (20 °C) was applied on the catheter surface [33].The applicator consists
of a coaxial monopole antenna, with a hemicylindrical metallic
reflector positioned to ensure propagation of electromagnetic
energy in the forward direction.One potential application is
for heating prostate targets with interstitial applicators.In order to reduce the antenna dimensions,
minimize heating of the ablation applicator and cool the inter-
facing tissues, the coaxial antenna and reflector were inserted in
a 3.5-mm (OD) catheter filled with circulating water.The modeling and
optimization techniques presented in this paper can be extended

?The optimized
antenna employed water (?r = 78 at 2.45 GHz) as the mate-

the critical spacing parameter d, allowing for a constructive in-

size.While currently available devices for MWA do not offer direc-

has been extensively characterized and affords dynamic con-
trol of heating profiles along the applicator length and angular
expanse [22], [23], [32].B. FEM Frequency-Domain Model of MWA

a highly conductive reflector to limit radiation in the reverse di-

Even though conventional PO is a valuable technique
adopted as a standard of care in many clinical environments,
it only permits the quantification of arterial oxygen saturation.For a broader assessment of blood
perfusion, this paper explores the utilization of dual-wavelength
PPG by using the pulsatile (ac) and continuous (dc) PPG for the
estimation of arterial oxygen saturation (SpO2 ) by conventional
PO.The technique has been
applied to measure cerebral and muscle perfusion, oxygen con-
sumption, and blood flow in tissues.PO is a noninvasive optical technique, which utilizes light at
two different wavelengths for the estimation of arterial oxygen
saturation.Additionally, the Beer–Lambert law is applied to the dc com-
ponents only for the estimation of changes in deoxyhemoglobin
(HHb), oxyhemoglobin (HbO2 ), and total hemoglobin (tHb) as in
NIRS.The system comprises a pro-
cessing system and a reflectance PPG probe, and it uses ac and
dc components for the estimation of arterial oxygen saturation
(SpO2) by conventional PO.62, NO.62, NO.Therefore, PPG so far has
been mainly utilized for the estimation of arterial oxygen satu-
ration by PO, with limited attempts in exploring the capability
and potentials of the technique for a more complete assess-
ment of tissue perfusion [31].The PPG trace, however, is not only used for the estimation
of SpO2 by PO.Furthermore, dc components are
processed separately, as in NIRS, to estimate changes of con-
centrations in HbO2 , HHb, and tHb using the Beer–Lambert
law.The PPG has been used for heart rate analysis, pulse
transit time estimation, blood pressure estimation, respiration
rate, vascular tone assessment, arterial and venous assessment,
tissue viability, vasomotor function, thermoregulation, and as a
perfusion indicator [13]–[19].Even though SpO2
and PPG waveform analysis provide a wide range of informa-
tion, the majority of research in this field focuses in PO, which
is a technique that does not indicate the correct blood perfusion
status [12], [20].The
ratio between ac and dc components [i.e., ratio of ratios, see (1)]
is directly correlated to arterial blood oxygen saturation (SpO2)
by empirical curves, permitting the continuous and noninvasive
monitoring of arterial oxygen saturation by PO [8]–[10], [12].An index representing the tissue hemoglobin saturation is
then estimated from the ratio of HbO2 and tHb [24].PO has found many applications in clinical and research set-
tings.The system was evaluated on the forearm of 21 healthy
volunteers during induction of venous occlusion (VO) and total
occlusion (TO).Several studies have been undertaken to prove
the ability of the PPG waveform on providing additional infor-
mation.2188 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING, VOL.

The four views shown were displayed on a monitor
in front of the participant.Every other participant is shown due to
space considerations.The lowest volume
group of about two to three participants appears to simply make
small movements around a central point, resulting in a fairly
spherical workspace.The ellipsoid is a simplified way to visualize the work
space, while preserving key characteristics of the workspace,
such as position, orientation, and size.However, this should only affect the very edges of the workspace
where manipulation becomes difficult.The distances from the initial object
position of each trial to the centroid for that trial are shown in
Fig.These distributions help illustrate what proportion of partici-
pants can achieve a given workspace size along the principal
axes found.For the two-finger case, R2 values for the
thumb and index finger are 0.75 and 0.94, respectively.The second axis length appears to be much closer to a nor-
mal distribution.This linear
scaling makes the ratio of the workspaces more meaningful than
the absolute size values.We hypothesized that this

might correspond well to the center of the Cartesian workspace,
in practice, we found the starting locations to be no closer than

Fig.While the above results show that the implant-based proce-

ence of the suture-based and implant-based procedures during
index-thumb precision grasp [36] was also analyzed.The knee joint torque was estimated using the force in
a virtual spring attached to the tibia.Specifically, our calculations show that the tendon
of one finger could travel up to 2.5 cm with a 3 cm long lever
after another finger is stopped due to contact during grasping.Third, in addition to fabricating the device using bio-
compatible materials such as titanium or ultrahigh molecular
weight polyethylene, the mechanism may have to be chemically
coated to reduce fibrosis when implanted in vivo long-term [42].2210 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING, VOL.2212 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING, VOL.

visual feedback, subjects were told to walk on the treadmill with
the intent of attaining the gait asymmetry observed during the first
implicit trial.All subjects were

were familiar with walking on a treadmill.This work was supported by the Gordon and

ventricular ejection fraction and study myocardial perfusion
scans.Voxels (x, y, z) with the same S-C radius coordinate R fall onto the same U shape [green dotted line in (b) and (d)].It is assumed that the minimum

orientation, the cardiac contours can only move in a direction
normal to the contour.With the help of a radial coordinate

acoustic collimator (d = 7 mm) was filled with an ultrasound gel and coupled
to the rat’s skull over the target cortex.Behavioral perfor-
mances were evaluated according to a set of NSS (0: normal; 18:
maximal deficit) modified from [23], which, respectively, evalu-
ated the deficits in motor, sensory, reflex, and balance functions
after the neurological injury (see Appendix B).Previous studies [12]–[17] showed that
shorter duration pulses of TUS could activate, whereas longer
pulses TUS were able to suppress the neural activity.Rat brains were frozen in –80-°C isopentane
immediately after euthanatizing the animal, and then were sec-
tioned into a thickness of 20 ?m.The sonication site was illustrated in Fig.After that brain slices were sequentially

In order to assess the neurological deficits in motor, sensory,
and balance functions, a well-trained examiner who was blind
to the experimental groups tested the behavior of the animals
before the surgery and 48 hr after dMCAO.The possible underlying mechanisms for such
stimulation-based therapeutics might be relevant to the restora-
tion of the balance of interhemispheric inhibition [7], [9].The area of infarction in both hemispheres on each
section was measured by the image analysis (Imaging J, version
1.61, NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA) of the brain slices.The brain slices were incubated in 2, 3, 5-
triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC, 2%, Sigma, St. Louis, MO,
USA) at?37 °C for 15 min in dark [24].The brain was carefully
removed, and sectioned into slices of 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2 (mm) along

human subjects, a model and a deconvolution algorithm that
includes the ACTH gain and cortisol negative feedback like the
model proposed in this study, we could find a range for model

cortisol levels collected at 10-min intervals, and z0 is a vec-

the adrenal glands’ cortisol concentration, and the serum cor-

In summary, we concluded
that this discrepancy is a result of using recording and segmen-
tation methods that more effectively utilize the lower end of the
frequency spectrum [22].No splines or other low-frequency removal tech-
niques were applied to the swallowing sound signals because
we had not investigated if such frequencies contained impor-
tant sound information.Cervical auscultation has traditionally been per-
formed using stethoscopes and microphones as sensors to detect
the sounds of swallowing and has not yet demonstrated suffi-
cient ability to characterize swallowing physiology or identify
aspiration [8]–[10].Previous research by Wang and

share certain physical similarities and are likely produced by
the same events in the body they cannot be considered identical

SIMULATOR SCANNING TRACKING SYSTEM
A key aspect of the training simulator is the ability to track
the position and orientation (“motion tracking”) of the sham
transducer relative to the PSS.It can track the orientation and position of an object in
6 DoF using a small sensor attached to the sham transducer
that detects the magnetic field from an electro-magnetic field
transmitter.At any given moment, the 2-D image is deter-
mined by the position and orientation of the sham transducer
on the PSS.Generally speaking, there are three commonly used categories
of tracking systems [35], electro-magnetic, electro-optical, and
electro-mechanical.This approach is promising, re-
tains diffraction, and shadowing effects, but is currently too
computationally demanding except for simple tissue structures
[25].2(a), where one window shows a rendering of
the body surface (the virtual torso).It is simple in design, uses a body
sized manikin and sham transducer with magnetic-based track-
ing sensors, and has a high level of user satisfaction [17].To minimize cost and space, these tracking
sensors were selected so that an external physical reference is
not required.A virtual transducer scans
the virtual torso by following the sham transducer movements on
the scan surface.The position and orientation of the sham transducer are
tracked with 5 DoF on an abdomen-sized scan surface with the
shape of a cylindrical segment.The part of the body surface
that can be scanned is unique to the selected 3-D image volume,
and a rendering of an actual transducer follows the movements
of the sham transducer (the virtual transducer).The EMTS [39], [40] has small latency (down to
5 ms), high accuracy (1 mm), medium cost, and no need
of line-of-sight to the objects, but it suffers from interferences
from metallic structures in the vicinity of the sensor.2(b), the
physical components consists of a PSS emulating a specific part
of the human anatomy, and the sham transducer with integrated
position and orientation tracking sensors providing 5 degrees
of freedom (DoF).This approach is less accurate compared to other three
2482 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING, VOL.Another window
contains the B-mode image, which is a slice through the selected
3-D image volume and is determined by the position and ori-
entation of the sham transducer, thus referred to as a “resliced”
image.J. Kutarnia is with the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering,

In order to generate sufficient deformation and

the petri dish.In addition,
the thin water layer between the embryo and the petri dish pro-

the rotational stage does not compromise the depth of field of
the microscope.As the effect of this thin layer of water between
the embryo and the petri dish on the friction coefficient is dif-
ficult to be measured, we chose to push the embryo down by
twice the x value to compensate for the decrease in the friction
coefficient.In
order to meet the requirements of the micromanipulation sys-
tem and suit the characteristics of the upright microscope, the
rotational stage conforms to the following requirements: 1) no
obstruction of the microscope’s field of view; 2) low height to
ensure that the sample is within the depth of field of the mi-
croscope and allow sufficient working space for operation; 3)

Negative binomial regression would have removed the
need to define any group thresholds in the analysis [18], but
would not have provided statistical justification for the unique
clinical distinction we used to separate the profiles of “fallers”
from “nonfallers” (see Figs.Determine the
data window required to reliably assess an increased propensity
for falling.The mode
of step-time variability (but not the mean) was significantly lower in non-
fallers (A—top) compared to fallers (B—bottom).Only nonfallers performed walks greater than 300 s.
In daily life, cadence was often observed to follow a bimodal
distribution (see Fig.Also, a greater proportion of the nonfaller’s walks were longer
(visualized by the flatter line of best fit) and closer to a simple
power law, as defined by a log-exponent (log10(X)1.5) closer to
unity relative to the faller’s log-exponent (log10(X)2.1).For the participant in the top panel,
clear separation between slow walking (88 steps/min) and fast walking (112
steps/min) was observed.Participants completed many short walks
and fewer longer walks.Gait intensity comprised measures of cadence (steps/min)
and vigor using the root mean squared (RMS) vertical (VT)
oscillation velocity [23].In our study, the fallers
took significantly fewer steps per walk and none completed
walks longer than 300 s. Fallers also took fewer steps per day
(2907) than nonfallers (4127), but this trend was not significant.With respect to the observed differences between fallers and
nonfallers, we acknowledge several limitations.Fallers had sig-
nificantly (p = 0.04) greater mode of variability (0.12 s) than
nonfallers (0.08 s).The distribution analyses of quantity and exposure
used walks greater than or equal to three steps, and the analyses
of intensity and quality used walks greater than or equal to eight
steps.4 and 5) were constructed
using the proportion of total steps taken (as a percentage) on
the vertical axis.On the other hand, walks of only three steps comprise mainly
of gait initiation [26], making comparisons with longer steady-
state walks difficult.Therefore, signifi-
cant memory and power savings might be possible by reducing
the sample rate, provided that a high sampling rate is not essen-
tial for detecting impacts caused by falling.Nonfallers wore the device more (67 days, SD
29) than fallers (44 days, SD 29), but this difference was not
significant (p = 0.1).With respect to the default sample rate of 50 Hz, the wavelet-
based analysis algorithm registered impacts caused by heel-
strikes occurring at a maximum of 3 Hz [8].2590 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING, VOL.2594 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING, VOL.

Instead, a thresh-
olding procedure was applied to the tangential speed to segment
the velocity profile.Averaged over 10,000 evalua-
tions, the average computation time to evaluate the cost function
scaled linearly with the number of submovements (R2 > 0.99,
p < 10?19 , evaluated up to 20 submovements).For clinical applications
where many movements must be analyzed or decompositions
must operate in real time, finding an exact solution requires an
unsuitable amount of computation time.Instead, random-restart
“scattershot” (SS) search retains advantages of joint optimiza-
tion with orders of magnitude less computation time [14].Further computational time savings might be acquired by per-
forming computation on a more specialized hardware platform
(e.g., graphical processing units).We
have described methods for accelerating such decompositions.For SA, we used the implementation built into
MATLAB’s optimization toolbox.= (t0 ,D) and tn = t?t0D is time normalized to the
duration of the movement.The constraints are necessary to ensure that the last column is
consistent with its interpretation as the tangential speed scal-
ing factor.Again, SA-SS required many more function evaluations than
SA-SP: an average of 68,000 for SA-SS versus 34,000 for SA-
SP.However, we still retain the property that g(t; t0 ,D,A) =
A · g(t; t0 ,D, 1), meaning that the SP method still applies.D. Optimization Methods

Abstract—Objective: Conventional inverse-scattering algorithms
for microwave breast imaging result in moderate resolution images
with blurred boundaries between tissues.Gaussian noise was added to obtain a 30-dB SNR, where SNR
is defined as the ratio of total nonmonostatic received power to
total noise power.Conclusion: Our level set method leads to a feasible level of com-
putational complexity for full 3-D imaging, and reconstructs the
heterogeneous dielectric properties distribution of the breast more
accurately than conventional microwave imaging methods.However, the inverse scattering problem
is ill posed, so microwave imaging performance depends heav-
ily on the algorithm used to reconstruct the dielectric properties
of the breast.The
high resolution images produced by our level set method yields
more accurate breast density estimates than those obtained with
Tikhonov-regularized Gauss–Newton methods.Reconstructions of the
dielectric properties are potentially useful for several clinical
applications including density estimation, tumor detection, and
treatment monitoring.This demonstrates our level set
method is robust to noise and assumed skin properties, both of
which are potential sources of error in clinical application.Recon-
structions of anatomically realistic numerical breast phantoms
demonstrate the ability of the proposed algorithm to reconstruct
the tissue structure better than conventional microwave imag-
ing approaches.10, OCTOBER 2015
A 3-D Level Set Method for Microwave
Breast Imaging
Timothy J.An algorithm for imaging several 3-D, homogeneous, nonover-
lapping targets is described in [6], but the only level set algo-
rithms suitable for imaging the spatially complex and heteroge-
neous tissue structure of the breast are applied to 2-D numerical
breast phantoms [4], [5].The ill posedness of the microwave
breast imaging problem is reduced by using a dispersive model
for the tissue dielectric properties and making measurements at
multiple frequencies.We demonstrate
the feasibility of 3-D imaging using simulated array measurements
from 3-D numerical breast phantoms.> 0) have dielectric properties that correspond to fibroglan-
dular tissue, and regions with (?Level set algorithms [4]–[6] for microwave imaging have
yielded high-resolution reconstructions of dielectric properties.These 3-D phantoms span the four breast density classes
defined by the American College of Radiology Breast Imaging
Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) Atlas.Recent 2-D numerical
microwave imaging studies demonstrate that the use of a level set
method preserves dielectric boundaries, resulting in a more accu-
rate, higher resolution reconstruction of the dielectric properties
distribution.The next section presents the physical relevance of the
level set technique for representing the dielectric properties of
breast tissue.2528 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING, VOL.2530 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING, VOL.

Acoustic shock wave was measured with a sound pressure
level (SPL) meter with an attenuator (2230 and ZF 0020; both
from Bru¨el & Kjær, Denmark), and by a microphone with a
preamplifier and an amplifier (4191, 2669, and Nexus; all from
Bru¨el & Kjær, Denmark), and a sound card (E-MU 0404 USB,
Creative, USA).Record-
ing at 341 000 FPS with Vision Research Phantom v2010 camera
revealed that initial arc descent was still vertical, but became ac-
companied by arcs leaning increasingly sideways; after 8–12 ?s,
as the first of these arcs formed direct contact with the receiving
electrode, it evolved into a channel of plasmified air and short-
circuited the electrodes.A high-pressure shock wave is formed in plasmified air dur-
ing the lightning stroke, which travels faster than the speed of
sound [36].While lightning also strikes natural habitats of many living
organisms, scientific interest in studying the effects of such ex-
posures has until recently been scarce.It is true that the very highest values of J and E caused by
lightning strokes do not occur in downscaled exposure systems,
yet under such extreme conditions, all living matter is damaged
lethally and through mechanisms that are now rather well un-
derstood: resistive heating, irreversible electroporation of cell
membranes, and irreversible electroconformational changes in
membrane proteins [27], [28], as well as electrolytic contami-
nation and degradation, including formation of gas bubbles in
cells and tissues [29].In particular, we have demonstrated that such
arcs, in which the electric field is accompanied by an acous-
tic shock wave, can cause killing of the generally extremely
resilient bacterial spores.Furthermore, natural competence is found in some bacteria
and in rare archaea [14], but there are no known naturally com-
petent eukaryotes (organisms whose cells’ genetic material is
contained in a nucleus), yet during the last five years the sci-
entists are increasingly acknowledging the evolutionary impor-
tance of HGT also in eukaryotes [15].In the last two decades, sequencing of genomes gradually
started revealing that biological evolution, particularly in uni-
cellular organisms, is influenced significantly by horizontal gene
transfer (HGT)—uptake of genetic material from their environ-
ment or other organisms, and its integration into the new host’s
genome [11].We have argued that a particularly promis-
ing such mechanism, with both theoretical and indirect empiri-
cal support, is lightning-triggered HGT—DNA transfer enabled
by lighting-induced cell membrane electroporation, and possi-
bly augmented by lightning-driven electrophoretic motion of
DNA [19].Cell membrane electroporation caused by high-voltage short-
duration electric pulses can be irreversible, killing the cells, but
it can also be reversible, with the exposed cells remaining vi-
able, which is increasingly exploited to introduce into living
cells various active substances that cannot permeate an intact
membrane, particularly anticancer drugs and genetic material
[6], [7].A likely contributor to
this was the prevailing view that a stroke can only harm the
organisms, and the mechanisms of inflicted damage—thermal
(degradation of biomolecules), electrical (electroporation of
cells’ membranes and resulting leakage of intracellular mate-
rial), and mechanical (pressure shock due to the strong acoustic
waves accompanying a stroke)—are generally rather well un-
derstood.We have recently posited that a possible answer to both early-
life and modern gene transfer into organisms lacking natural
competence lies in physical (as opposed to biochemical) mech-
anisms of DNA release and uptake, which could have functioned
from the very beginning of cell-based life, and which also func-
tion in eukaryotes.The currently recognized
mechanisms of HGT in eukaryotes are gene transfer from their
intracellular symbionts [16] and from infecting viruses [17],
but it has been demonstrated that the most important genes
transferred into eukaryotes by HGT stem from archaea [18],
and whether these can all be attributed to transfer from en-
dosymbionts (which are overwhelmingly bacteria, not archaea)
or viruses is highly questionable.Spores were
purified by centrifugation (5 min, 10 000 g) and cleaning (by
0.05% SDS, then three times by deionized water), and spread
onto agar on 90-mm petri dishes.In this paper, we included the experiment on bacterial spores
primarily as an example of our system’s use, but in experiments
aimed at elucidating the (bio)physical, (bio)chemical, and bio-
logical effects of arc discharges on living matter, considerable

The center of the grid corresponded to
the center of the muscle volume projected on the skin surface.C. Simulation Study
In this section, high-density EMGs were simulated to inves-
tigate the effect of the detection system size and of the localized
distribution of muscle activity on monopolar EMGs referred to
a remote reference, to the VR and to the FVR.According to (4),
the interference-free monopolar signals (Sk (t)) are obtained,
for each channel k, by subtracting the new reference signal from
each detected signal, Vk (t).Moreover, when the potential distribution is sampled with
a grid of electrodes, the nonuniform spatial distribution of the
surface potential (e.g., the transversal decay in case of skin
parallel-fibered muscles) is expected to be an additional fac-
tor degrading the quality of the signals detected with the VR
technique.The surface potential was simulated as detected by the three
detection systems in two conditions.For EEG applications this requirement is
approximately fulfilled by high-density detection systems, with
electrodes covering the whole scalp.It
is therefore relevant for EMG applications benefiting from a clean
monopolar detection (e.g., decomposition, control of prosthetic de-
vices, motor unit number estimation).For each detection system a schematic representa-
tion of the simulated fibers is shown (IZ: innervation zone, TR: tendon region).The block diagram of the FVR method is reported in Fig.(a)
Schematic representation of three detection systems: two linear arrays with
four and ten electrodes (DS 1 and DS 2, respectively) and a grid of 5 × 10
electrodes (DS3) placed on one side of the innervation zone (monodirectional
propagation).The application of this tech-
nique to high-density EMG recordings can be more problematic
because the surface integral of the potential can be considered
null only when the detection system covers the entire muscle
surface and goes beyond the tendon regions.The electrodes of the 5× 40 array were grouped in subsets to
obtain different detection systems [5× 20 array and 5× 8 array,
see Fig.The second step of the method (block “Amplitude Compensa-
tion”) corresponds to the estimation of the scaling factor pk for
each channel of the detection system.Each detection system was arranged around the
center of the 5 × 40 array., M) of the detection system.It would
therefore appear that a method to reduce power line interference
could be based on the differential measurement of the voltage
between each electrode of the array and the instantaneous spa-
tial average of all the detected signals.The equivalent spatial impulse response (2) and the transfer
function in time frequency domain (3) are

Thereby, the inlet view was obtained by tilting the X-ray
source from an AP position around the transversal body axis
caudally by approximately 25?.Therefore, the objective of this study was to develop and
evaluate a complete system of X-ray image calibration, 2-D/3-D
pelvis reconstruction, and subsequent, automatic acetabular cup
planning.The planning of
the stem implant will include the compensation for potential leg
length discrepancy and the definition of the osteotomy plane
on the femoral bone.In
order to accomplish these requirements and to reduce preoper-
ative planning time, the automatic cup planning technique as
proposed by Otomaru et al.The outlet view was
obtained by tilting the X-ray source from an AP position around
the transversal body axis cranially by approximately 60?.Thus, the correspondences were restricted to the
hemipelvis only and cross matchings between the hemipelvises
could be avoided [22].But this magnification factor is only valid for a particular ratio
of x-ray source to patient distance and patient to film distance.As only the X-ray source needs
to be moved, the patient will remain in the supine position.After the first instantiation
step, the correspondences are updated and used as input for the
second instantiation step.In order to analyze the validity of the 2-D/3-D reconstruction
technique for preoperative planning, the next step will also fo-
cus on the estimation of the stem prosthesis.More
trials need to be performed to investigate the optimal angle
between the AP and the oblique (e.g., inlet, outlet, ...) view.In order to set up the
correspondences robustly, the 2-D contours and the vertices
of the mean model were assigned either to the left or right

Several studies
have shown the effect of EP on the passive electrical properties
of single cells [33]–[35], cell suspension [36]–[38], adherent
cell cultures [39], [40], and living tissues [41].For most thermal-based tissue ablation mecha-
nisms, the created lesions are commonly monitored through
ultrasound, magnetic resonance, or computer tomography imag-
ing systems, which are not accurate in the description of the area
of treatment nor do they provide information in an active manner
[19].The PEFs were generated using an ECM 830 pulse
generator (Harvard apparatus, Holliston, MA, USA) and deliv-
ered to the tissue through a commercially available IRE bipolar
probe (AngioDynamics, Latham, NY, USA).Although this method is effective
for determining the changes in tissue properties after uniform
IRE treatment, it does not provide information about the geome-
try of the ablated tissue.The
temperature increase due to Joule heating happening close to
EP leads is also another source of error.EP is a
method used to increase the permeability of cell membranes to
ions and macromolecules by exposing them to short yet intense
pulsed electric fields (PEFs) [2].Electric cell-substrate impedance spec-
troscopy is a popular technique for monitoring the growth,
motion, integrity, and permeability of 2-D cell cultures [28],
[29].could be regarded as a measure of a distribution
of the resistance–capacitance combination and is related to the
morphology of the extracellular space [63].To resolve this issue, a 100-nm-thick SiO2 passivation
layer was deposited on the sensing area of the impedance probe
using E-beam evaporation.We used the impedance spectra,
along with an electrical model of the tissue, to obtain critical pa-
rameters such as the conductivity of the tissue before, during, and
after completion of treatment.The results
from our computational model, which was constructed based
on uniform electric field data, correlated well with the lesion
dimensions.After fitting, the Rec resistance
is extracted as a measure of the sample resistance at low fre-
quency [53].The physics involved in solving for the elec-

are cumbersome and time consuming to use, disruptive during

introduce a numerically efficient and stable tridomain formula-
tion.As observed in experimental studies, the retro-
grade propagation incrementally captured greater portions of

unit area.The linear solution performance for the tridomain equations
(1)–(3) was compared to an earlier formulation known as the ex-
tended bidomain [19].At present, such studies require extensive and expensive trial-
and-error experiments with animal models [11].However,
this “extended-bidomain” formulation results in nonsymmetric
systems of equations, limiting the choice of efficient and stable
linear solvers.An alternative to the single-cell
type and extracellular space bidomain formulation that accounts
for the multiple cell types present in the stomach has been re-
cently proposed by Buist and colleagues [18], [19].Mathematical models are increasingly successful and robust
for in-silico analysis of bioelectric activity [12], [13] and are
therefore a potentially useful tool for investigating SW response
to stimulation, prior to focused experimental studies [11].In
systems with single-cell types, balancing current conservation
between intra and extracellular spaces with membrane elec-
trophysiology results in coupled reaction-diffusion equations,
commonly referred to as the bidomain equations.However, in intact in-vivo tissue, ICC
are entrained to a single frequency corresponding to the highest
frequency present, which is critical for a coordinated motility
of the GI tract [1], [4].A tridomain simulation was performed
with solution points at different spatial resolutions ranging from
0.1 to 2 mm.The TetGen quality parameter of the gen-

help position the discs, and the ALL and PLL ligaments.Once the endplate
borders have been identified, the points are resampled to place
a consistent number of uniformly spaced landmarks for every
specimen, enabling correspondence (see Fig.Most published SSMs of bones use different

DQE requires measurements of the system’s modulation trans-
fer function (MTF) and noise power spectrum (NPS), which de-
scribe the system’s spatial resolution and noise characteristics,
respectively.A nonlinear least squares fit operation was carried out in
order to establish a mapping function between the CHA density
and pixel gray level in the form
I = Ae?bx + C (4)
where A, b, and C are constants, I is the detected gray-level
intensity, and x is the known density of the CHA.The higher CV values may be attributed to the fact
that in our study calibration was carried out prior to scanning
test subjects, whereas calibration data in the other studies were
simultaneously acquired during the scanning of the test subjects.The sum of the mineral
and nonmineral components of bone gives the total thickness
of bone which can then be used to compute the volume of the
bone.To evaluate the short-term precision of a densito-
metry technique, it is recommended to take two measurements
per individual in a minimum of 30 subjects or three measure-
ments per individual in a minimum of 14 subjects and comput-
ing the coefficient of variation (CV) [46], [47].5

for segmenting the bone of interest in this study.The reference vBMD for evaluating the algorithm-determined
vBMD was generated by dividing the ash weight by the refer-

composition to compute the thickness of the bone at each pixel
point (the missing information in a 2-D image).To overcome this drawback, the reference vBMD could be
determined through peripheral quantitative CT or the volume
of the bone could be measured using a bone histomorphometry
technique followed by derivation of the vBMD through dividing
the ash weight by that volume.The reference volume
of each bone was measured by placing the bone in a measuring

of water displaced, which is equal to the volume of the bone.5) Pixel size: 120 ?m.An earlier study on this machine

the detector length and width are 690 and 15 mm, respectively.The calibration

were scanned, rather than scanning the phantom together with

INTRODUCTION
TRANSCRANIAL magnetic stimulation (TMS) is atechnique for noninvasive stimulation of the human brain.Head tissues in the coronal slice of y = 80 mm.Stimulation is produced by generating a brief, transient high
intensity magnetic field by passing a brief, transient electric cur-
rent through a magnetic coil placed upon the scalp.For HCA coil
with current flowing in the same direction in each of two coils,
it enables the stimulation of the brain at greater depth than is
currently achievable with the conventional round coil.The field intensity of electric field in brain tissues at coronal
slice of y = 80 mm (as shown in Fig.Index Terms—Coaxial circular coils, deep brain stimulation,
impedance method, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS).It was observed relatively high electric fields were in-
duced in the area of the skull orbit in Fig.Coronal slice of the head model at y = 80 mm.Some important brain subregions such as hippocampus, mid-
brain, pons, pineal body, thalamus, etc., have been included in
the model.Dependence of brain tissue volume with (E > 100 V/m) on the depth

we investigated the tissues at the cross section of head model

of the distance from the vertex of the head is plotted in Fig.The five-sphere model consisted of five concentric shells—

frequency and time resolution.Moreover, their stopband

We performed the spiral scans four times.To deal with
larger variation, several removable scanning tips with different
lengths could be customized.12(a).12(b).12(c).12.E. Control Algorithms and Trajectory
We developed a custom user interface to control the prototype
from a standard PC.4 en-
larged view).Another possible drive mechanism is to use rotational joints
with bevel gears such as in [29] and [30].In particular, because of the size and
shape restrictions of bevel gears, the mechanisms in [29] and
[30] make it difficult to achieve a small outer diameter with a
large channel.This allowed us to obtain high-quality mosaics
using a simple and fast normalized cross-correlation algorithm,
as we did not need to consider rotations.The position of the
peak of the cross correlation was taken to be the shift between
the two images.Furthermore, it
is particularly difficult to reduce the backlash when there are a
large number of gears.The spherical spiral with equal spacing between turns has two
parameters: the radius of the sphere rsphere and the number of
turns N [see Fig.Com-

is correlated with the SV and, when combined with HR, yields CO.10 plots
J-wave amplitudes versus SVs from 13 subjects.Many key cardiovascular parameters including heart
rate (HR), stroke volume (SV), and the pre-ejection period (PEP)
have specific applications in the field of CVD monitoring.An example is atrial fibrillation, which is the most
common form of cardiac arrhythmia and increases the risk of
stroke and heart failure [2].However, for the
target application of long-term wearable monitoring, numerous
measurement periods exist throughout the day when the wearer
is at less than 4 mG of acceleration [16].Reference equipment was
then attached to the subject, which included a Criticare 504-US
chest ECG (lead II configuration) and finger pulse oximeter, a
Sonosite BioZ Dx impedance cardiography (ICG) machine for
measuring PEP and CO, and a Finapres Portapres for continuous
blood pressure measurements.However,
this is sufficient for calculating the RJ interval, which is defined
as the interval between the ECG’s R-wave and the BCG’s J-wave
[13], [14] and has high correlation with the heart’s PEP [15],
[16].The ear is demonstrated as a
natural anchoring point for the integrated sensing of physiological
signals.The highest peak of the cross-correlation result
occurs when the ECG’s R-wave and the BCG’s J-wave coincide
during time-shifting.C. Extracting the RJ Interval
To extract the RJ interval, the simplest method is to use a peak
detection algorithm to determine the delay between the ECG’s
R-wave and the BCG’s J-wave.Obtaining HR from the BCG, ECG, and PPG
signals can be used for redundancy error checking to ensure
high signal quality.As a measure of the heart’s pumping
ability, SV is an important parameter for congestive heart failure
(CHF) patients.The measurements are not simultaneous.When SV is multiplied with HR, cardiac output (CO) can be
obtained, which is defined as the total volume of blood pumped
per minute.Compared to measurements that use the R-wave of the

insulin metabolism, caused by saturation and inhibition effects
evidenced by chemical substrates and hormones involved in en-
zyme dynamics and hormonal control effects, 2) time delays
in subcutaneous–subcutaneous (sc-sc) route due to the delayed
effect of infused subcutaneous insulin and the glucose diffusion
from the blood to the subcutaneous space, and 3) inaccura-
cies in subcutaneous glucose measurements.As more and more data are gathered, data processing and
interpretation become more crucial in order to turn acquired
data and information into knowledge toward supporting dia-
betes decision making and action and providing powerful tools
for the patient and the clinician.However,
their acceptance has been limited because they take into account
only a confined number of factors affecting glucose metabolism,
while the identification of their parameters requires clinical mea-
surements, which are not typically available in clinical settings.: REVIEW OF EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF DM 2739
Fig.Predicted
glucose profile is mainly used for producing early warnings of
the upcoming hypoglycemic/hyperglycemic episodes or for ad-
justing insulin injections and insulin infusion rate in insulin-
treated patients.Taking into account that the DM pathophysiology is a con-
tinuing process, transient critical abnormalities should be early
detected.This is mainly due to the biased data analysis and the
lack of reliable and comprehensive evaluation studies, since the
criteria for selecting patients and controls and the approaches for
the treatment of controls vary greatly among published studies
[131].
